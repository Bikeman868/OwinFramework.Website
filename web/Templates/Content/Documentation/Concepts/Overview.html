<h1>Conceptual Overview</h1>

<p>
    OWIN provides a set of standards for writing web applications that allow code from different authors to work together.
    These standards have the following layers:
</p>

<h2>OWIN</h2>

<p>
    The <span class="code">Owin.dll</span> assembly was writtin by Microsoft and is distributed as a NuGet package.
    It defines an interface between the web server and the web application. This allows any web hosting
    implementation to work with any application, so that you can host your web
    application on IIS, Apache, as a stand-alone Windows Service or even in a console
    application. This also means that framework builders can target OWIN and the consumers
    of the framework can choose any hosting platform which gives the framework far greater reach.
</p>
<p>
    The OWIN assembly defines one interface called <span class="code">IAppBuilder</span> that looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
public interface IAppBuilder
{
   IDictionary&lt;string, object> Properties { get; }
   object Build(Type returnType);
   IAppBuilder New();
   IAppBuilder Use(object middleware, params object[] args);
}
</pre>

<p>
    The world view of OWIN can be depicted like this:
</p>

<p>
    OWIN sits between the hosting software and your application so that your application
    can run on any host without modification.
</p>

<h2>Microsoft OWIN</h2>

<p>
    The <span class="code">Microsoft.Owin.dll</span> assembly is layered on top 
    of <span class="code">Owin.dll</span>. It wraps <span class="code">IAppBuilder.Properties</span> in
    <span class="code">IOwinContext</span> and defines the application as having a pipeline of middleware
    components chained through <span class="code">Func&lt;Task></span> references.
</p>
<p>
    The Microsoft OWIN package also contains an <span class="code">AppBuilder</span> class which is a concrete
    implementation of <span class="code">IAppBuilder</span> and defines a set of <span class="code">Use</span> 
	extension methods for <span class="code">IAppBuilder</span> that add middleware into a chain.
</p>
<p>
    When writing middleware components using the Microsoft OWIN assembly the standard 
    implementation pattern is to write a class with a public <span class="code">Build</span> method and private 
    <span class="code">Invoke</span> method like this:
</p>
<pre>
public class MyMiddleware
{
   public void Build(IAppBuilder app)
   {
      app.Use(Invoke);
   }
   
   private Task Invoke(IOwinContext context, Func&lt;Task> next)
   {
      return next();
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
    The middleware developer should also provide a <span class="code">Use</span> extension for 
    <span class="code">IAppBuilder</span> that adds their middleware into the pipeline. This 
	extension method typically looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
public static IAppBuilder Use(this IAppBuilder appBuilder, MyMiddleware myMiddleware)
{
   myMiddleware.Build(appBuilder);
   return appBuilder;
}
</pre>
<p>
    This allows the application dveloper to construct a middleware pipeline using code like this:
</p>
<pre>
public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
{
   app.Use(new Middleware1())
      .Use(new Middleware2())
      .Use(new Middleware3())
      .Use(new Middleware4());
}
</pre>
<p>
    This works because each middleware defines an extension method on the
    <span class="code">IAppBuilder</span> interface called <span class="code">Use</span> that
	returns the <span class="code">IAppBuilder</span> instance.
</p>
<p>
    The world view of Microsoft OWIN (Katana) can be depicted like this:
</p>

<img class="app_diagram" src="/assets/images/drawings/Katana_world_view{_v_}.svg" alt="Katana world view" />

<p>
    Katana extends the base OWIN concept by defining the application as a pipeline of
    middleware components where each middleware can choose to process the incomming http request
    or not, can choose to process the outgoing http reply or not, and can pass the request to the
	next middleware in the chain or not.
</p>

<h2>Owin Framework</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">OwinFramework.dll</span> assembly is layered on top the <span class="code">Microsoft.Owin.dll</span> 
    assembly by adding standardization for common middleware functionality like identification, authorization, session etc. 
	This standardization provides the following benefits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Application developers can seamlessly swap out any implementation of a particular type 
        of middleware for any other implementation without breaking their OWIN pipeline.
    </li>
    <li>
        Middleware developers can focus on doing a really good implementation of one piece 
        of middleware and assume that other contributors will provide the other pieces needed to 
		build a complete application.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This OWIN Framework also provides a routing mechanism, middleware dependency resolution and 
	a flexible standardized way of configuring middleware components.
</p>
<p>
    To take an existing middleware and make it work with the OWIN Framework the middleware 
    developer needs to implement <span class="code">IMiddleware&lt;T></span> where <span class="code">T</span> 
    defines if this is identification, authorization, session or whatever middleware. For generic 
	middleware or application specific middleware <span class="code">T</span> can be <span class="code">object</span>.
</p>
<p>
    A minimal implementation of <span class="code">IMiddleware&lt;T></span> that can be chained
	into the pipeline but does nothing, looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
public class MyMiddleware: IMiddleware&lt;object>
{
   public string Name { get; set; }

   private readonly IList&lt;IDependency> _dependencies = new List&lt;IDependency>();
   public IList&lt;IDependency> Dependencies { get { return _dependencies; } }

   public Task Invoke(IOwinContext context, Func&lt;Task> next)
   {
      return next();
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
    Notice that to change existing middleware to be compatible with the OWIN Framework all 
    we have to do is add a couple of properties and make the existing <span class="code">Invoke</span> 
    method public. These changes allow middleware to be named and have dependencies on other middleware. 
    For example an implementation of identification might have a dependency on session.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to use existing middleware that does not support the OWIN Framework and you don't have 
    source code then there is a <span class="code">LegacyMiddlewareWrapper</span> class that will allow 
    you to use it with the OWIN Framework.
</p>
<p>
    If you are starting from scratch, you can copy the code above and use it as a starting point for 
	any new middleware that you write.
</p>
<p>
    When using the Owin Framework, the code that the application developer writes to configure the 
	pipeline of middleware changes to a fluent syntax like this:
</p>
<pre>
public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
{
   var builder = new Builder();

   builder.Register(new NotFoundError())
      .As("staticFilesNotFoundError")
      .RunAfter("loginId")
      .ConfigureWith(configuration, "/owin/notFound/staticFiles");

   builder.Register(new FormsIdentification())
      .As("loginId")
      .ConfigureWith(configuration, "/owin/auth/forms")
      .RunOnRoute("secure");

   app.Use(builder);
}
</pre>
<p>
    Note that the <span class="code">Builder</span> class from the example above is middleware 
    from the Katana world view perspective, and it contains its own mechanism for chaining middleware. 
    One of the reasons why the Owin Framework does this is because it support dependency 
    resolution between middleware, allows multiple routes to be configured, and has an upstram 
    and downstream method for middleware to communicate about the request processing.
