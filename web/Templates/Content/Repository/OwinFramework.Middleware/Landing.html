<title>The OwinFramework.Middleware Repository</title>
<h2>The Middleware Repository</h2>

<p>
    This GitHub repository contains a Visual Studio solution that compiles
    various useful middleware. The Owin Famework is designed to allow Middleware
    from many authors to work seamlessly together, so this is not intended as
    a complete set of middleware.
</p>

<p>
    The middleware in this solution provides a basic implementation of essential
    middleware to get the ball rolling - no middleware means nobody using the
    framework means nobody developing middleware etc. This repository is designed
    to break that cycle.
