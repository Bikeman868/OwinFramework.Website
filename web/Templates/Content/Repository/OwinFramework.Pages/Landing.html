<h2>The Pages Repository</h2>

<p>
    This GitHub repository contains a Visual Studio solution that compiles
    the middleware that implements the Pages functionallity. This functionallity
    is feature comparable with Microsoft ASP.Net, Microsoft Katana or Microsoft Core
    but has a very different design with the goal of being an open architecture
    as well as community owned.
</p>
<p>
    The projects in this repository are part of the
    <a href="/content/area/pages/landing">Pages Functional Area</a>.
    Please read that section for overview documentation on how to use these packages.
