<p>
    This package contains a Build Engine for services. If you want the fluent 
    builder to use this build engine you need to add a couple of lines to
    your startup code similar to:
</p>

<pre>
    var fluentBuilder = ninject.Get&lt;IFluentBuilder>();
    ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Pages.Restful.BuildEngine>().Install(fluentBuilder);
</pre>

<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<p>
    After adding this build engine to the fluent builder you can add web services
    to your application by writing classes that are decorated with attributes.
    The fluent builder will discover these classes and use the attributes to configure 
    these services.
</p>

<h2>Sample Service</h2>
<p>
    The code below is taken from one of the sample applications. It is a 
    service that exposes 4 endpoints that add, subtract, multiply and divide 
    two numbers.
</p>
<p>
    You can invoke this service by typing a URL into a browser similar to
    <span class="code">http://mycompany.com/math/add?a=45&b=76</span>.

            var b = request.Parameter&lt;double>("b");
            request.Success(a / b);
        }
    }

<div class="app_warning">
    When writing services you must ensure that the data types produced
    by the parameter validator are of the same type as requested by your
    code. In the example above all parameters are declared as
    <span class="code">double</span> and retrieved as <span class="code">double</span>
    in the code.
</div>

<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>
    The class that defines your service must be decorated with an
    <span class="code">[IsService()]</span> attribute as shown in the
    example above.
</p>
<p>
    Your class can contain any number of methods. Any or all of these
    methods can be exposed as REST endpoints by decorating the method
    with an <span class="code">[Endpoint()]</span> attribute.
</p>
<p>
    Endpoint methods can optionally be decorated with one or more 
    <span class="code">[EndpointParameter()]</span> attribute
    to define the parameters that can be passed to the method.
</p>

<h2>Supported Features</h2>
<p>
    This service builder supports the following features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A root path is usually specified for the service. By default the method
        name will be used as a sub-path below this root. The URL is not
        case sensitive. You can override the default path to an endpoint by
        passing a parameter to the <span class="code">[Endpoint()]</span> attribute. 
        This endpoint path can be relative to the service root or an absolute path
        within the website.
    </li>
    <li>
        The service can be configured to only process requests with certain
        methods and pass on any other requests to the rest of the routing
        chain. For example you might only want to handle POST requests in
        the service and allow GET requests for the same URL to pass through
        to the page rendering.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can define a permission that the calling identity must have to be 
        allowed to call this service and optionally restrict access further by
        passing the service/method name as a resource path when checking
        permissions. You can also override the service settings on each endpoint.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can specify a request deserializer and a response serializer for
        the service, and you can override this for each service endpoint. If
        you do not specify these then they default to Json using the NewtonSoft 
        library.
    </li>
    <li>
        Endpoint parameter attributes define the name of the parameter and
        the validator to use. The validator is specified as a 
        <span class="code">Type</span>. This <span class="code">Type</span> can
        be a value type like <span class="code">int</span> or <span class="code">double</span>
        which makes the parameter required, or it can be a nullable type like
        <span class="code">int?</span> which makes the parameter optional but when
        present must be of the correct type.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the endpoint parameter validation you can also supply a <span class="code">Type</span>
        that implements <span class="code">IParameterValidator</span>. A few
        validators are provided with this package. You can also write your own
        validator containing your application logic.
    </li>
    <li>
        Endpoint parameter attributes also define the methods that the caller can
        use to pass the parameter. The default is to only allow parameters in
        the query string, but you can have any combination of: query string, custom header
        form field or path element.
    </li>
</ul>
