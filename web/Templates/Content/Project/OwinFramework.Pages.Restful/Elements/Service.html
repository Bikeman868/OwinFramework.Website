<title>Restful service element reference | The OWIN FRamework</title>
<h2>Service Page Elements</h2>
<p>
    Service elements handle requests matching the path and methods configured
    then return responses that are calculated in application code. Services are
    typically used to provide endpoints that Javascrpipt can call using AJAX.
    When these calls are made, the service endpoint validates and parses its
    input parameters, performs some processing and returns a response.
</p>

<h2>Attribute Example</h2>
<p>
    This is an example of defining a service element using a class decorated with
    attributes.
</p>
<pre>
[IsService("order", "/order/", new[] { Method.Post, Method.Get, Method.Put, Method.Delete })]
public class OrderService
{
    [Endpoint(UrlPath = "{id}", Methods = new[] { Method.Get })]
    public void Get(IEndpointRequest request)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    In this use case the <a href="../../attributes/isservice"><span class="code">[IsService()]</span> attribute</a>
    has properties that specify how Http requests are routed to the service.
