<h2>Service Endpoint Response Serialization</h2>
<p>
    Services and service endpoints can specify the response serializer
    to use when the service endpoint constructs a reply. The serializer
    is responsible for producing the entire response including headers
    and the response body. This provides total flexibility and control
    over how the service responds.
</p>
<p>
    The setting on the service is the default for all endpoints that
    do not specify a serializer. If the service does not specify a 
    serializer then Json is the default.
</p>
<p>
    The serializer is specified as a class type to use. This class type
    must implement the <span class="code">IResponseSerializer</span> interface.
