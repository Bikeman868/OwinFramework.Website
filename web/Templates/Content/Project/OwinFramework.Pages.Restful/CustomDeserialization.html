<h2>Service Endpoint Body Deserialization</h2>
<p>
    Services and service endpoints can specify the request deserializer
    to use when the service endpoint accesses the body of the request.
    Note that if the body is not read by the application code then the
    deserializer is not called.
</p>
<p>
    The setting on the service is the default for all endpoints that
    do not specify a deserializer. If the service does not specify a 
    deserializer then Json is the default.
</p>
<p>
    The deserializer is specified as a class type to use. This class type
    must implement the <span class="code">IRequestDeserializer</span> interface.
</p>
<p>
    If the service endpoint method reads the body of the request multiple
    times then the body of the request will only be deserialized once.
</p>
<p>
    The standard libraries already contain some implementations of 
    <span class="code">IRequestDeserializer</span>  that you can take
    advantage of in your application, but this interface is also
    straightforward to implement. These classes are in the 
    <span class="code">OwinFramework.Pages.Restful.Serializers</span>
    namespace.
