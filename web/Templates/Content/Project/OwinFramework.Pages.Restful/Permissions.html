<h2>Service Endpoint Permissions</h2>

<p>
    Services and service endpoints can have a required permission set.
    When calls are made to the service by identities that do not have this
    permission they will receive an access denied response and the 
    service endpoint code will not execute.
</p>
<p>
    For this to work you must include Authorization middleware in your
    OWIN pipeline. Any middleware that implements the the authorization 
    mechanism can be used.
</p>

<p>
    You can decorate your service and service endpoints with the
    <a href="attributes/requiresidentification"><span class="code">[RequiresIdentification]</span> attribute</a> and/or the
    <a href="attributes/requirespermission"><span class="code">[RequiresPermission]</span> attribute</a> to control
    who has access to your service and its endpoints.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">EndpointSpecificPermission</span></h3>

<p>
    This is a property of the <a href="attributes/endpoint"><span class="code">[Endpoint]</span> attribute</a>
    and the <a href="attributes/isservice"><span class="code">[IsService]</span> attribute</a>. When this
    property is <span class="code">true</span> the name of the service
    and method name are passed as the asset name to the authentication
    check separated by a forward slash. This allows you to define
    permissions that allow access to service methods using wildcards,
    for example you can give one group of users permission to call any
    endpoint in the service whilst other groups of users can only call
    certain specific endpoints.
