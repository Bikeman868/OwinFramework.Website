<h2>The <span class="code">[CacheOutput]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Optionally attach this attribute to a web service to instruct the output
    cache middleware how to cache the response. This is only effective if you
    have installed and configured some output caching middleware.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsService("order", "/order/", new[] { Method.Get })]
[CacheOutput("Order", CachePriority.Low)]
public class OrderService
{
}
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[CacheOutput()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">CacheCategory</span></h3>

<p>
    The value of this property is passed directly to the Output Cache middleware
    when this service handles the request. The Output Cache middleware
    can use whatever logic it wants to decide how long to cache data based on
    this category name.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">CachePriority</span></h3>

<p>
    The value of this property is passed directly to the Output Cache middleware
    when this service handles the request. The Output Cache middleware
    can use whatever logic it wants to decide how long to cache data based on
    this priority level.
</p>
