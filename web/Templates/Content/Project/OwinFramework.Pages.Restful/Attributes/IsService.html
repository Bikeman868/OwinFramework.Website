<title>[IsService] attribute | The OWIN Framework Restful</title>
<h2>The <span class="code">[IsService]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a class to identify it as a web service.
    To register this service with the router and send requests to it you can get the
    fluent builder to scan the assembly containing your class, or you can register
    it in code.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsService("order", "/order/", new[] { Method.Post, Method.Get, Method.Put, Method.Delete })]
public class OrderService
{
    [Endpoint(UrlPath = "{id}", Methods = new[] { Method.Get })]
    public void Get(IEndpointRequest request)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[IsService()]</span> attribute has properties
    that specify how Http requests are routed to the service as folllows.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">BasePath</span></h3>

<p>
    This property of the <span class="code">[IsService()]</span>
    attribute establishes a route for the service. Any Http requests
    that match this at the start of their path will be compared to the
    service endpoints for possible routing to that endpoint. If the
    base path does not match the Http request then this service is
    skipped and routing moves onto the next service.
</p>
<p>
    For efficiency you should always specify a base path for each
    service and organize your service endpoints so that all the
    endpoints in a serice have the same base path. This arrangement
    provides the most efficient routing of requests.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not specify a base path then it defaults to
    <span class="code">/</span> effectively making all of
    endpoints within the service have absolute paths.
</p>
<p>
    The base path should end with a forward slash because it is
    concatenated with the relative path of each endpoint to form the
    full path of the endpoint. If you forget to append a forward
    slash then one will be appended automatically for you.
</p>
<p>
    The base path can contain wildcards for some path elements but must
    not end with a wildcard. Since it is designed to match the start of
    the Http request it will be added to the routing table with <span class="code">**</span>
    on the end allowing the endpoints to have any relative path below
    this base.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Methods</span></h3>

<p>
    This property of the <span class="code">[IsService()]</span>
    attribute defines the Http methods that will be routed to the
    service. If you do not specify the <span class="code">Methods</span>
    it will default to <span class="code">new []{ Method.Post }</span>. In this
    case the service will only receive Http POST requests. To handle other
    kinds of Http request you must set the <span class="code">Methods</span>
    property.
</p>
<p>
    You can route all Http methods to the service by setting
    <span class="code">Methods</span> to an empty
    array like this: <span class="code">new Method[]{ }</span>
</p>
<p>
    Only methods that are routed to the service itself can be further routed
    to the endpoints within the service with relative paths. Endpoints with
    absolute paths are chained into the routing at the root level and do not
    have this restriction.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Priority</span></h3>

<p>
    This property of the <span class="code">[IsService()]</span>
    attribute defines the order in which routing will be evaluated.
    The highest priority routes are considered before the lower priority ones.
    Since the default priority is zero, the recommentation is to make very
    specific routes have positive priorities and wildcard routes have negative
    priority so that the wildcard routes do not mask the more specific routes
    by matching the request first.
</p>
<p>
    Priorities also affect performance because the router will try to match
    routes in order or highest to lowest priority until it finds a match.
    You can make routing more efficient by giving higher priority to routes
    that are matched more frequently.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Analytics</span></h3>

<p>
    Set this property to define how detailed are the analytics that are
    measured for the endpoints of this service. You can use intellisense to
    see the possible values for this property.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">RequestDeserializer</span></h3>

<p>
    Defines the type of deserializer to use when the body of the request
    is accessed for the first time by the application code. Setting this
    on the service makes it the default deserializer for all endpoints in
    this service, but it can also be overidden for each endpoint.
</p>
<p>
    The deserializer is specified as a class type to use. This class type
    must implement the <span class="code">IRequestDeserializer</span> interface.
</p>
<p>
    The standard libraries already contain some implementations of
    <span class="code">IRequestDeserializer</span>  that you can take
    advantage of in your application, but this interface is also
    straightforward to implement. These classes are in the
    <span class="code">OwinFramework.Pages.Restful.Serializers</span>
    namespace.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ResponseSerializer</span></h3>

<p>
    Set this property to define how objects returned from service
    endpoints are written to the http response. The default serializer
    serializes the returned object to Json using the NewtonSoft serializer.
</p>
<p>
    Setting this property on the service makes it the default for all
    of the service endpoints, but this can also be overidden for each
    endpoint.
</p>

<p>
    The serializer is specified as a class type to use. This class type
    must implement the <span class="code">IResponseSerializer</span>
    interface. There are implementations of this interface in the
    <span class="code">OwinFramework.Pages.Restful.Serializers</span>
    namespace.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">RequiredPermission</span></h3>

<p>
    Setting this property means that identities that call this endpoints
    of this service will have to have this permission assigned to them in
    the authorization middleware. Setting this property on the service
    makes it the default for all endpoints of the service. The value
    can be overidden for each enpoint if desired.
</p>
<p>
    Note that this property only has effect if your application includes
    authorization middleware in the Owin pipeline.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">EndpointSpecificPermission</span></h3>

<p>
    When this property is <span class="code">true</span> the name of the service
    and method name are passed as the asset name to the authentication
    check separated by a forward slash. This allows you to define
    permissions that allow access to service methods using wildcards,
    for example you can give one group of users permission to call any
    endpoint in the service whilst other groups of users can only call
    certain specific endpoints.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ParameterSpecificPermission</span></h3>

<p>
    This property defines the name of a parameter to the endpoint that
    will be passed to the authorization check at the asset value. For
    example you can have an endpoint that updates a users avatar that
    takes <span class="code">userId</span> as a parameter, then you
    can set "userId" as the value of the
    <span class="code">ParameterSpecificPermission</span>, in which case the
    value of the <span class="code">userId</span> parameter will be passed
    to the authorization middleware as the asset name, and you can configure
    the authorization middleware to only grant this permission if the
    user id is your own user id. You can also define a group of users
    in the authorization middleware who can call this endpoint for any
    user id.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ScenarioName</span></h3>

<p>
    This parameters allows you to define different versions of your service
    for different segments of users in A/B testing scenarios.
</p>

<h2>Endpoint Routing</h2>

<p>
    Endpoints can have relative or absolute paths. This decision fundamentally
    changes the routing model for the endpoint.
</p>
<p>
    When endpoints have a relative url path (that does not begin with a forward slash)
    the endpoint is considered to be within the service and only requests routed to
    that service can end up at this endpoint.
</p>
<p>
    When endpoints have an absolute url path (that begins with a forward slash)
    the endpoint is included directly into the root routing table and is indendant
    of any routing applied to the containing service. In this case there is still
    advantages in building a service with multiple endpoints because they inherit
    the settings for serialization, deserialization etc.
