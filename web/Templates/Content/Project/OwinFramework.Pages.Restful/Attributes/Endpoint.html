<h2>The <span class="code">[Endpoint]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a method to identify it as a web service endpoint.
    The class containing this method must be decorated with the <span class="code">[IsService]</span>
    attribute for this to work.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsService("order", "/order/", new[] { Method.Post, Method.Get, Method.Put, Method.Delete })]
public class OrderService
{
    [Endpoint(UrlPath = "{id}", Methods = new[] { Method.Get })]
    public void Get(IEndpointRequest request)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[Endpoint()]</span> attribute has properties
    that specify how Http requests are routed to the service as folllows.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">UrlPath</span></h3>

<p>
    Specifies the Http path of this endpoint relative to the service <span class="code">BaseUrl</span>
    property. The endpoint can also specify an absolute path by starting this
    property value with a forward slash.
</p>

<p>
    If you do not set this property value then the name of the C# method
    will be used as the relative path.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Methods</span></h3>

<p>
    For endpoints with an absolute <span class="code">UrlPath</span> this property
    defines the Http methods that will be routed to this endpoint.
</p>
<p>
    For endpoints with a relative <span class="code">UrlPath</span> this property is
    a further restriction that is applied after the request is successfully routed
    to the service. In this case there is no point in adding methods here that are
    not also in the <span class="code">Methods</span> property of the service.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Analytics</span></h3>

<p>
    Set this property to define how detailed are the analytics that are
    measured for this endpoint. You can use intellisense to
    see the possible values for this property.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">RequestDeserializer</span></h3>

<p>
    Defines the type of deserializer to use when the body of the request
    is accessed for the first time by the application code.
</p>
<p>
    The deserializer is specified as a class type to use. This class type
    must implement the <span class="code">IRequestDeserializer</span> interface.
</p>
<p>
    The standard libraries already contain some implementations of
    <span class="code">IRequestDeserializer</span>  that you can take
    advantage of in your application, but this interface is also
    straightforward to implement. These classes are in the
    <span class="code">OwinFramework.Pages.Restful.Serializers</span>
    namespace.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ResponseSerializer</span></h3>

<p>
    Set this property to define how objects returned from this
    endpoint are written to the http response. The default serializer
    serializes the returned object to Json using the NewtonSoft serializer.
</p>

<p>
    The serializer is specified as a class type to use. This class type
    must implement the <span class="code">IResponseSerializer</span>
    interface. There are implementations of this interface in the
    <span class="code">OwinFramework.Pages.Restful.Serializers</span>
    namespace.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">RequiredPermission</span></h3>

<p>
    Setting this property means that identities that call this endpoint
    will have to have this permission assigned to them in the authorization
    middleware.
</p>
<p>
    Note that this property only has effect if your application includes
    authorization middleware in the Owin pipeline.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">EndpointSpecificPermission</span></h3>

<p>
    When this property is <span class="code">true</span> the name of the service
    and method name are passed as the asset name to the authentication
    check separated by a forward slash. This allows you to define
    permissions that allow access to service methods using wildcards,
    for example you can give one group of users permission to call any
    endpoint in the service whilst other groups of users can only call
    certain specific endpoints.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ParameterSpecificPermission</span></h3>

<p>
    This property defines the name of a parameter to the endpoint that
    will be passed to the authorization check at the asset value. For
    example you can have an endpoint that updates a users avatar that
    takes <span class="code">userId</span> as a parameter, then you
    can set "userId" as the value of the
    <span class="code">ParameterSpecificPermission</span>, in which case the
    value of the <span class="code">userId</span> parameter will be passed
    to the authorization middleware as the asset name, and you can configure
    the authorization middleware to only grant this permission if the
    user id is your own user id. You can also define a group of users
    in the authorization middleware who can call this endpoint for any
    user id.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ScenarioName</span></h3>

<p>
    This parameters allows you to define different versions of your service
    endpoint for different segments of users in A/B testing scenarios. For example
    one group of users might see data sorted differently or have additional data
    included in the response so that you can measure the preferences of your usres.
