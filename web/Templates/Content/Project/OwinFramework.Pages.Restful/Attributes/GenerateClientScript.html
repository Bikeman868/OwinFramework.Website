<title>[GenerateClientScript] attribute | The OWIN Framework Restful</title>
<h2>The <span class="code">[GenerateClientScript]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Optionally attach this attribute to a web service to create a component
    that will render Javascript that makes it very easy to call the
    endpoints of the service.
</p>
<p>
    Other page elements that will call this service can have the
    <span class="code">[NeedsComponent]</span> attribute attached to them to
    indicate that they have a dependency on this Javascript and ensure that
    it is included on all pages where it is needed.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsService("order", "/order/", new[] { Method.Get })]
[GenerateClientScript("order-service-client")]
public class OrderService
{
    [Endpoint(UrlPath = "id/{id}")]
    [EndpointParameter("id", typeof(AnyValue<long>), EndpointParameterType.PathSegment)]
    public void GetOrderById(IEndpointRequest request)
    {
        var id = request.Parameter&lt;long>("id");

        // Use data access layer to retrieve the order details
    }
}

[IsRegion("order-region")]
[NeedsComponent("order-service-client")]
[NeedsComponent("libraries:ajax")]
public class OrderRegion { }
</pre>

<p>
    In this example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Any page that includes the <span class="code">order-region</span> region knows
        that it must render the <span class="code">order-service-client</span> component
        because of the <span class="code">[NeedsComponent]</span> attribute on the region.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <span class="code">order-service-client</span> component will write Javascript
        where it is accesible to the page. Where exactly it gets written depends on the
        asset deployment mechanism that you configured.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Javascript that is produced depends on the ajax library, so this region also
        specifies that the ajax library is required wherever this region is used.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <span class="code">GetOrderById</span> method of the order service can now be
        called using one line of Javascript similar to
        <span class="code">ns.myApp.orderService.getOrderById({id: 123},function(order){})</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        I called the service <span class="code">order</span> but the Javascript function is
        called <span class="code">orderService</span>. This is by convention. The
        <span class="code">[GenerateClientScript]</span> attribute appends "Service" to the
        service name to avoid naming conflicts in the generated Javascript.
    </li>
    <li>
        The generated Javascript is in a namespace. The Pages Framework uses a convention where
        all namespaces are contained in the <span class="code">ns</span> property of the
        <span class="code">window</span> object, so the fully qualified name of the function
        call begins with <span class="code">ns.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        In this example I used <span class="code">myApp</span> as the namespace name. The actual
        namespace that is required here is defined by your Package. You can have multiple application
        packages, but many websites will have only one. You should substitute <span class="code">myApp</span>
        in the example above with the namespace name of your application package.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the C# code the method is called <span class="code">GetOrderById</span> but the Javascript
        calls <span class="code">getOrderById</span>. This is another convention. When generating
        the Javascript the first letter is converted to lower case to make the Javascript more
        conventional.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Javascript <span class="code">getOrderById</span> takes up to 4 parameters. In this example
        I only passed the first two. The first parameter is the parameters that are expected by the
        service endpoint (in this example just the "id"). The second parameter is a function that
        will be called if the request succeeds. The function will be passed a Javascript object
        that will be a Javascript representation of whatever C# object you serialized as the response
        from your service endpoint.
    </li>
</ul>
