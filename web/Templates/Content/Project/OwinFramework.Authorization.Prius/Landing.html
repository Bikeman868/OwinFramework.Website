<title>The OwinFramework.Authorization.Prius Project</title>
<p>
    The <a href="/content/repository/OwinFramework.Authorization/readme">authorization repository readme</a>
    file contains documentation on the key concepts around authorization in the Owin Framework. It is strongly
    recommended that you read it before using this assembly.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides an implementation of the <span class="code">IAuthorizationData</span> interface.
    To make this implementation available to other packages that need this interface you just need to add
    the NuGet package to the project - that's it, there is nothing else to do.
</p>

<div class="app_warning">
    This package persists authorization data using the Prius ORM. You will need to create a database
    and configure Prius within your application for this to work. The source code for this project
    includes an SQL folder containing the SQL scrips you need to create the database.

        The <span class="code">defaultGroup</span> is the code name of an authorization group whose permissions
        should be assigned to any user that is identified but was not specifically assigned to any group. This

    </li>
    <li>
        The <span class="code">administratorGroup</span> is the code name of an authorization group whose

        The <span class="code">anonymousGroup</span> is the code name of an authorization group whose
        permissions apply to users that were not identified. This is typically users who have not
