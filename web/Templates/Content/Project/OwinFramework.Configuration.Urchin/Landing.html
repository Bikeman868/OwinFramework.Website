<p>
    Add this package to your application and your Owin Framework components will use
    Urchin for their configuration.
</p>

<div class="app_hint">
    No other code changes are required. Simply adding the package via NuGet will 
    register the <span class="code">IConfiguration</span> implementation with IoC.

<p>
    Urchin is a centralized rules based configuration management system where 
    components are configured using snippets of Json, and the application 
    developer can decide on the overall structure of their configuration file. 
    The source code and documentation for Urchin is <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/Urchin">here</a>.
</p>

<div class="app_warning">
    You will need to install the Urchin Client package for this to work, but you do not need
    to be using the Urchin server. See Urchin documentation for full details.
