<h2>Component Elements</h2>
<p>
    Component elements are the leaves of the tree structure that defines
    an HTML page. The components are responsible for writing the HTML
    to the response that is sent back to the browser. The HTML to write
    is defined in C# code.
</p>
<div class="app_hint">
    <p>
        Note that you do not have to create C# classes for every piece of content,
        that would be extremely time consuming and hard to manage. There are higher
        level facilities that create components for you, for example the template
        loader and template parser mechanism creates and configures a component for
        each template.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="app_hint">
    <p>
        You will typically only write component classes to gain access to low level control
        over the HTML that is produced, for example to write custom headers into the
        <span class="code">&lt;head>&lt;/head></span> section of the page.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="app_hint">
    <p>
        You can write components to simplify your chosen scheme for editing and presenting
        content. For example this website that documents the Owin Framework has a component
        that maps the page URL onto a template path allowing me to define one page that
        renders hundreds of different templates creating all of the pages on the website with
        very little code.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Components have the following features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">HeadWriters</span>
        property and they will be called during the rendering of the page head. This allows
        your component to write meta tags, links etc into the head of the page.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">ScriptWriters</span>
        property and they will be called during the rendering of the javascript that is
        embedded into the page.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">StyleWriters</span>
        property and they will be called during the rendering of the CSS that is
        embedded directly into the page.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">BodyWriters</span>
        property and they will be called during the rendering of the page body. This is
        how things like template parsers configure components to render the template.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">InitializationWriters</span>
        property and they will be called during the rendering of the page body after all of
        the components on the page have rendered their body content. This is a good place to
        write javascript code to execute initialization functions.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">CssRules</span>
        property and they will be called during the rendering of the CSS assets. CSS assets
        maybe written into the page, or maybe written into an asset resource that is
        referenced by the page. This is determined by the asset deployment mechanism that is
        configured.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">JavascriptFunctions</span>
        property and they will be called during the rendering of the Javascript. The Javascript can
        be rendered into the page head, or into a separate Javascript file depending on the
        asset deployment mechanism selected.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can override the <span class="code">GetPageAreas</span> method to indicate
        which areas of the page your component will write to. To improve page rendering
        efficiency the rendering engine will prune areas of the tree that contain no
        components that render to a specific portion of the page when that part of the
        page is being rendered.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can override the <span class="code">GetCommentName</span> method to provide a
        custom comment. These comments are written to the HTML when comments are turned on
        for debugging purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can override the <span class="code">WritePageArea</span> method to output custom
        HTML in any area of the page where this component exists. Note that this is only
        guaranteed to be called for page areas returned by the <span class="code">GetPageAreas</span>
        method, but it may also be called for areas that are not returned by the
        <span class="code">GetPageAreas</span> if this component has children that render into
        those areas.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can override the <span class="code">WriteStaticCss</span> method to define what
        CSS gets written into asset resources associated with this component.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can override the <span class="code">WriteStaticJavascript</span> method to define what
        Javascript gets written into asset resources associated with this component.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Attribute Only Components</h3>

<p>
    There are some situations in which you might want to define a component with no C#
    implementation because all of the required funcionality can be achieved through adding
    attributes to the component. For example:
</p>
<pre>
[IsComponent("defaultStyles")]
[PartOf("application")]
[DeployedAs("content")]
[DeployCss("p", "font-size:11pt;")]
[DeployCss("h1", "font-size:16pt;")]
[DeployCss("h2", "font-size:14pt;")]
[DeployCss("h3", "font-size:12pt;")]
internal class DefaultStylesComponent { }
</pre>
<p>
    By decorating your component with the <span class="code">[IsComponent("component_name")]</span> attribute
    you do not have to manually register each component with the Fluent Builder, instead you can ask the
    Fluent Builder to register everything in your assembly and it will use reflection to find all of the
    components.
</p>
<p>
    The attributes that you can attach to a component are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="../attributes/iscomponent"><span class="code">[IsComponent]</span></a> identifies this class as a component</li>
    <li><a href="../attributes/deploycss"><span class="code">[DeployCss]</span></a> css rules to include on any page that includes this component</li>
    <li><a href="../attributes/deployfunction"><span class="code">[DeployFunction]</span></a> a Javascript function to include on any page that has this component on it</li>
    <li><a href="../attributes/deployedas"><span class="code">[DeployedAs]</span></a> specifies how Javascript and CSS should be deployed for this component</li>
    <li><a href="../attributes/needscomponent"><span class="code">[NeedsComponent]</span></a> identifies a dependent component</li>
    <li><a href="../attributes/needsdata"><span class="code">[NeedsData]</span></a> identifies data that is required for this component</li>
    <li><a href="../attributes/partof"><span class="code">[PartOf]</span></a> defines the package (namespace) for CSS and Javascript in this component</li>
    <li><a href="../attributes/renderhtml"><span class="code">[RenderHtml]</span></a> makes this component render localized HTML</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing Custom HTML</h3>

<p>
    To write custom HTML to anywhere on the page override the <span class="code">WritePageArea</span>
    and <span class="code">GetPageAreas</span> methods. For example:
</p>
<pre>
[IsComponent("person")]
[NeedsData(typeof(Person))]
internal class PersonComponent : Component
{
    public PersonComponent(IComponentDependenciesFactory dependencies)
        : base(dependencies)
    {
    }

    public override IEnumerable&lt;PageArea> GetPageAreas()
    {
        return new[] { PageArea.Body };
    }

    public override IWriteResult WritePageArea(IRenderContext context, PageArea pageArea)
    {
        if (pageArea == PageArea.Body)
        {
            var person = context.Data.Get&lt;Person>();
            context.Html.WriteElementLine("p", person.Name);
        }
        return WriteResult.Continue();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">WritePageArea</span> method is called once for each component
    instance on the page when rendering the body of the page, but only once when rendering
    all other parts of the page. For example if I put the same component on my page 3
    times, the body page area will be written 3 times (in each of the locations where I
    placed the component) but anything that this component renders in the page head,
    initialization area etc will only be written once.
</p>
<p>
    If the component is inside of a region that repeats its content, this is the same
    as adding the component multiple times. Each time the region repeats the body
    area will be written again, but the page head will only be written once.
</p>
<p>
    To be more specific, if your component writes to the
    <span class="code">&lt;head>&lt;/head></span> section of the page and the component is
    included multiple times on a page, then the <span class="code">WritePageArea</span> method
    will only be called once for each page with the <span class="code">pageArea</span>
    parameter set to <span class="code">PageArea.Head</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">WritePageArea</span> method must return an instance of the
    <span class="code">IWriteResult</span> interface. You can implement this interface
    yourself, or you can use static methods of the <span class="code">WriteResult</span>
    class. The purpose of the <span class="code">IWriteResult</span> is to let the rendering
    engine know if or when you are finished writing your HTML. The static methods of
    <span class="code">WriteResult</span> work like this:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="code">WriteResult.Continue()</span> means I have finished writing all of my Html
        but other components should be run to contribute output as well. This is the most frequently
        used use case.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="code">WriteResult.ResponseComplete()</span> means I have finished writing all of my Html
        and the response is now complete so do not render output from any other controls. This is
        mostly usefull when wtiring to the page title and you do not want to concatenate the results
        of all component that write to the page title.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="code">WriteResult.ContinueAsync(action)</span> means that my Html takes a long
        time to produce, so kick it off in a background thread and continue running other components.
        If other components also return <span class="code">WriteResult.ContinueAsync(action)</span> then
        these operations will continue in parallel on different threads. This option requires some special
        programmming to ensure that the asyncrhronously produced Html ends up in the correct sequence
        in the response. See section on this below.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="code">WriteResult.WaitFor(task)</span> means that I started a background task to
        write my Html. Please wait for this task to complete before sending the response back to the browser.
        In the meantime the other components on the page will continue processing and outputting their Html.
        See section below on asyncrhronously writing to the Html output stream.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Consuming Data in your Component</h3>
<p>
    If your component needs data from a data provider it is better NOT to inject the data provider
    directly or look in the data catalog for it. Instead you should decorate your class with the
    <span class="code">[NeedsData()]</span> attribute. If you do it this way there are several advantages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you place multiple components on the page that need the same data the data provider will only be called once.</li>
    <li>If you place the component inside a repeater that repeats the data it needs then it will work as expected.</li>
    <li>If the dependant data is available with multiple scopes then the page designer can choose which scope to apply and your component will receive the correct version of the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Here is an example of a component that uses data. This example will render Html for an address
</p>
<pre>
    [IsComponent("address")]
    [NeedsData(typeof(Address))]
    internal class AddressComponent : Component
    {
        public AddressComponent(IComponentDependenciesFactory dependencies)
            : base(dependencies)
        {
        }

        public override IWriteResult WritePageArea(IRenderContext context, PageArea pageArea)
        {
            if (pageArea == PageArea.Body)
            {
                var address = context.Data.Get&lt;Address>();
                context.Html.WriteElementLine("p", address.Street);
                context.Html.WriteElementLine("p", address.City);
                context.Html.WriteElementLine("p", address.ZipCode);
            }
            return WriteResult.Continue();
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[NeedsData()]</span> attribute causes the requested type of data to be
    added to the <span class="code">IRenderContext</span> where you can retrieve it by calling the
    <span class="code">Get&lt;T>()</span> method of its <span class="code">Data</span> property.
</p>

<h3>Asyncronous HTML Output</h3>
<P>
    The Pages Framework is designed to be extremely flexible and scaleable and therefore prvides
    a mecahnism to allow components to contribute asynchronously to the Html output. Here is an example:
</P>
<pre>
public override IWriteResult WriteBodyArea(IRenderContext context)
{
    var html = context.Html;

    // Save this location in the output buffer
    var begining = html.CreateInsertionPoint();

    // Write a paragraph of text
    html.WriteElementLine("p", "This is paragraph 2");

    // Write a paragraph of text in a background thread
    var task = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
        {
            // Simulate a call to a service or database here
            Thread.Sleep(10);

            begining.WriteElementLine("p", "This is paragraph 1");
        });

    // Write a third paragraph of text
    html.WriteElementLine("p", "This is paragraph 3");

    return WriteResult.WaitFor(task);
}
</pre>
<p>
    In this example the resulting web page will contain the three paragraphs in
    numeric order even though paragraph 1 was written after the other two.
</p>

<h3>Components as Services</h3>
<p>
    You can decorate your component's class with the <span class="code">[IsService]</span>
    attribute to allow it to handle AJAX calls and Postbacks from the browser. There
    are a few supported use cases as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Make your component class inherit from the <span class="code">Service</span>
        class then implement the <span class="code">IComponent</span> inferface.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make your component class inherit from the <span class="code">Component</span>
        class but also add a default public constructor that can be used to construct
        the class as a service.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make your component class inherit from the <span class="code">Component</span>
        class but and pass the optional factory method when registering with the
        fluent builder. The builder will use the factory to construct a second
        instance of your component to act as the service.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    This technique is especially useful for modularizing your AJAX calls because you
    can write a component the will write Javascript functions to call the service,
    and also implement the service endpoints within the same class keeping these
    things close together. In this case adding the component to a website adds both
    the JavaScrpipt to call the service and the service endpoints.
</div>
<div>
    Postbacks are a bit more tricky in that they have to re-render the page after
    handling the postback. Exactly how you do that depends a lot in the overall
    architecture of your solution.
</div>

<h3>Components in packages</h3>

<p>
    You can create a reusable plug-in package. These packages can contain functionallity that can be added to
    a website with a single line of code. This technique is most often used to build open-source packages that
    are designed to be added to many websites and fulfill some common need, but you can also manage your own
    application using packages if you choose.
<p>
<p>
    When you create a package, the package's <span class="code">Build</span> method is called at startup. This is
    where the package creates all of the pages, layouts, components etc that comprise the package contents. This
    <span class="code">Build</span> method is passed an instance of <span class="code">IFluentBuilder</span> that
    can be used to build all of the package contents. The fluent builder has a namespace context that avoids namespace
    clashes with other packages and/or application code.
</p>
<p>
    This is an example of using the fluent builder to build a component.
<p>
<pre>
public class CmsEditorPackage: IPackage
{
    public CmsEditorPackage()
    {
        Name = "cms_editor";
        NamespaceName = "cmseditor";
    }

    IPackage IPackage.Build(IFluentBuilder fluentBuilder)
    {
		// ... some code omitted here for brevity
			
        var assetsComponent = fluentBuilder.BuildUpComponent(null)
            .Name("assets")
            .DeployIn(module)
            .DeployFunction(null, "initVue", null, script.ToString(), true)
            .RenderInitialization("cms-editor-init", "<script>ns." + NamespaceName + ".initVue();</script>")
            .DeployLess(less.ToString())
			.Build();

        return this;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    Note that the Owin Framework NuGet package installs the xml documentation file alongside the dlls
    so you can get intellisense for the methods available in the fluent syntax.
</p>
<p>
    Note that you can combine all of these techniques together, for example you can write a class that
    inherits from <span class="code">Component</span> but also overrides methods of the base class, and
    uses the fluent builder syntax. This is illustrated in the example below:
</p>
<pre>
public class LibrariesPackage : Framework.Runtime.Package
{
    public LibrariesPackage(IPackageDependenciesFactory dependencies)
        : base(dependencies)
    {
        Name = "libraries";
        NamespaceName = "libraries";
    }

	[DeployedAs(AssetDeployment.InPage)]
    private class LibraryComponent : Component
    {
        public string[] Urls { get; set; }

        public LibraryComponent(IComponentDependenciesFactory dependencies, params string[] urls)
            : base(dependencies)
        {
            PageAreas = new[] { PageArea.Head };
            Urls = urls;
        }

        public override IWriteResult WritePageArea(IRenderContext context, PageArea pageArea)
        {
            if (pageArea == PageArea.Head)
            {
                foreach (var url in Urls)
                    context.Html.WriteElementLine("script", string.Empty, "src", url);
            }

            return WriteResult.Continue();
        }
    }

    public override IPackage Build(IFluentBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.BuildUpComponent(
            new LibraryComponent(
                Dependencies.ComponentDependenciesFactory, 
                "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"))
            .Name("jQuery1")
            .Build();

        return this;
    }
}
</pre>
