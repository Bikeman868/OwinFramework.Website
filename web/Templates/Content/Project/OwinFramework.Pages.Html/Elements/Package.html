<h2>Package Elements</h2>
<p>
    Package elements define a namespace for Css and Javascript assets to avoid name conflicts.
    When importing a 3rd party package into your application you can change the namespace name
    of the package and all of its assets will be renamed making it always possible to avoid
    naming conflicts.
</p>

<h2>Attribute Example</h2>
<p>
    You can define a package by decorating a class with the <a href="../attributes/ispackage"><span class="code">[IsPackage()]</span> attribute</a>.
    This defines a namespace for your Css and Javascript assets. You should do this within your website to seperate your
    application assets from any imported packages.
</p>
<p>
    Below is an example of defining a package namespace and telling a Region to
    put its assets into this namespace. In this case I decided to create a base
    class with the <a href="../attributes/partof"><span class="code">[PartOf()]</span> attribute</a>
    and have my region inherit that, so that I don't need to remember to add the
    <a href="../attributes/partof"><span class="code">[PartOf()]</span> attribute</a>
    to each element that I define.
</p>
<pre>
[IsPackage("my_website", "app")]
internal class ApplicationPackage { }

[PartOf("my_website")]
internal class ApplicationElement { }

[IsRegion("div")]
internal class DivRegion : ApplicationElement { }
</pre>
<p>
    In this use case the <a href="../attributes/ispackage"><span class="code">[IsPackage()]</span> attribute</a>
    has properties that specify the default namespace to use for all Css and Javascript assets built by this package.
</p>

<h2>Package Classes</h2>
<p>
    The other main user case for packages is to make a reusable package of elements that
    can be imported into a website to add features. For example the CMS piece of the Owin
    Framework has an editor for managing the pages of the website, and this editor is
    contained within a package. By adding the package to a website this editor UI can be
    dropped into any page within the website.
</p>
<p>
    The most likely reasons for creating packages are either: a) providing some reusable
    functionallity as a NuGet package that website authors can install into their solution;
    or b) you have many web properties and want to share funtionallity accross them by
    compiling a shared assembly.
</p>
<p>
    Below is the source code for the data package from the
    <span class="code">OwinFramework.Pages.Standard</span> project. This is a fairly simple
    package that creates a single component, which deploys a Javascript library. The Javascript
    is compiled into the DLL in this case, so you only need to copy a single file to include the
    functionallity into a website.

    public class DataPackage: IPackage
    {
        private readonly ResourceManager _resourceManager;

        string IPackage.NamespaceName { get; set; }
        IModule IPackage.Module { get; set; }
        ElementType INamed.ElementType { get { return ElementType.Package; } }
        string INamed.Name { get; set; }

        public DataPackage(IHostingEnvironment hostingEnvironment)
        {
            var my = this as IPackage;
            my.Name = "data";
            my.NamespaceName = "data";

            _resourceManager = new ResourceManager(hostingEnvironment, new MimeTypeEvaluator());
        }

        IPackage IPackage.Build(IFluentBuilder fluentBuilder)
        {
            var resource = _resourceManager.GetResource(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), "dataModule.js");
            if (resource.Content == null) return this;

            var javaScript = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(resource.Content);

           fluentBuilder.BuildUpComponent(null)
                .Name("data")
                .AssetDeployment(AssetDeployment.PerWebsite)
                .DeployScript(javaScript)
                .Build();

            return this;
        }
    }
}

    In this example you can see that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To implement the a<span class="code">IPackage</span> interface from scratch is quite easy. You
        can also inherit from the built-in <span class="code">Package</span> class to make the implementation even smaller.
    </li>
    <li>
        The package can use construstor injection of dependencies provided the website developer uses IoC to construct the package.
    </li>
    <li>
        The important part of the package implementation is the <span class="code">Build()</span> method.
        This method is responsible for constructing all of the components, regions, layouts, data providers, pages etc
        within the package. This can be done using the instance of <span class="code">IFluentBuilder</span> that is
        passed to the <span class="code">Build()</span> method as a parameter.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <span class="code">IFluentBuilder</span> interface defines a number of <span class="code">BuildUpXxxx()</span>
        methods that you can use to build all of the different kinds of page elements. These methods can be passed
        an instance to build up, or they can be passed <span class="code">null</span> to use the default implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The return value from the various <span class="code">BuildUpXxxx()</span> methods is an interface that defines
        fluent methods that will configure everything that can be configured for that type of page element. You can
        use the Visual Studio intellisense information to see what all of these things are.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you are done configuring your element, there is a <span class="code">Build()</span> method that you need to call to
        actually construct an intance and register its name so that it can be resplved by other elements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Some other things to note are
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <span class="code">IFluentBuilder</span> instance that is passed in is already in the context of this package,
        so you not need to explicitly add all of your elements to the package.
    </li>
    <li>
        The package constructor usually sets a namespace, but this can be overriden at run-time by the application developer
        to avoid naming conflicts between packages. This means that it is very important to ensure that your code does
        not make any assumptions about what the namespace is.
    </li>
</ul>
