<h2>Module Elements</h2>
<p>
    Module elements define a module name and an asset deployment mechanism 
    for all of the page elements that use this module.
</p>

<h2>Attribute Example</h2>
<p>
    Since modules have no real functionallity, you will almost always create them
    by decorating an empty class with attributes as illustrated below:
</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p>
    In this use case the <a href="../attributes/ismodule"><span class="code">[IsModule()]</span> attribute</a>
    has properties that specify how the assets for elements in this module are deployed.
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to create a class that inherits from the built-in <span class="code">Module</span> class,
    but there is very little point in doing this.
</p>

<h2>Adding a Module to a Package</h2>

<p>
    If you want to define a module within your package (which is generally a
    good idea if your package contains any Css or Javascript assets), you can
    use the <span class="code">BuildUpPackage</span> method of the fluent builder.
    This technique is very similar to all of the other <span class="code">BuildUpXxxx</span> 
    methods that you use to build your package.
