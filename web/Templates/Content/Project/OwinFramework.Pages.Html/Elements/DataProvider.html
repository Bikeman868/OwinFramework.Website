<h2>Data Provider Elements</h2>
<p>
    Data Provider elements add data to the rendering context so that
    other elements on the page can use this data.
</p>

<h2>Data Provider Class Example</h2>

<p>
    All data providers must have a C# implementation to be useful. It is not
    possible to retrieve data from somewhere and add it to the rendering
    context by decorating classes with attributes only.
</p>
<p>
    Below is a very simple data provider that illsutrates the basic principal.
</p>
<pre>
    internal class ApplicationInfo
    {
        public string Name => "My Application";
    }

    [IsDataProvider("application", typeof(ApplicationInfo))]
    internal class ApplicationInfoDataProvider : DataProvider
    {
        private readonly ApplicationInfo _applicationInfo;

        public ApplicationInfoDataProvider(IDataProviderDependenciesFactory dependencies)
            : base(dependencies)
        {
            _applicationInfo = new ApplicationInfo();
        }

        protected override void Supply(
            IRenderContext renderContext,
            IDataContext dataContext,
            IDataDependency dependency)
        {
            dataContext.Set(_applicationInfo);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    You can see from this example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A Data Provider is a class that inherits from <span class="code">DataProvider</span> or
        implements the <span class="code">IDataProvider</span> interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Data Provider class should be decorated with the <a href="../attributes/isdataprovider"><span class="code">IsDataProvider</span> attribute</a>
        unless you plan to manually register the Data Provider with the Name Manager, or you are including
        the Data Provider in a package.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="../attributes/isdataprovider"><span class="code">IsDataProvider</span> attribute</a>
        defines the name of the Data Provider, the type of data that it provides, and the context in which
        it can provide that data.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the Data Provider inherits from the <span class="code">DataProvider</span> class, then it must
        override the <span class="code">Supply()</span> method and call the <span class="code">Set()</span>
        method of the Data Context.
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="app_warning">
    It is very important that the Data Provider actually provides the data that it claims to provide through its
    <span class="code">IsDataProvider</span> attribute. It is OK for the Data Provider to set a
    <span class="code">null</span> value in the Data Context, but it must not return from the <span class="code">Supply()</span>
    method without setting any value, because this will result in an infinite loop in the code.
</div>
<p>
    Some other things about Data Providers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A Data Provider can supply multiple kinds of data. In this case you can advertise those other
        data types by adding <a href="../attributes/suppliesdata"><span class="code">SuppliesData</span> attributes</a>
        to the Data Provider class.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            When page elements need data they can specify a data context name. This can be used to differentiate
            between multiple providers of the same kind of data, or these contexts can all be handled by the
            same data provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="../attributes/isdataprovider"><span class="code">IsDataProvider</span> attribute</a>
            and the <a href="../attributes/suppliesdata"><span class="code">SuppliesData</span> attribute</a> have an
            optional data context name that makes the Data Provider specific to that context for that type of data. If the
            optional data context name is not set then the Data Provider is advertising that it can fulfil this type
            of data for any context, in which case it needs to examine the <span class="code">IDataDependency</span>
            parameter passed to the <span class="code">Supply()</span> method, and supply data in the requested context.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example of using different data context names, consider a website where you can view the profile pages
            of other users. On this page you want to data bind to a user view model, but there are two possible users, the
            user whose profile page you are viewing or the user who is logged into the website. In this situation you
            can create separate Data Providers for these use cases, or have one Data Provider that handles both.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Data Provider can have a dependency on another named data provider, or a specific type of data.
            For example I might have a Data Provider for customer data and a Data Provider for a list of
            customer orders that depends on the customer Data Provider. You can define these dependencies by
            decorating your Data Provider class with the <a href="../attributes/needsdata"><span class="code">NeedsData</span> attribute</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Below is an example of a Data Provider that depend on other data. This
    is a more complex example where <span class="code">PersonListProvider</span> supplies
    a list of people and <span class="code">PersonAddressProvider</span> does not
    directly depend on the data provided by <span class="code">PersonListProvider</span>, but
    depends on a single person. These Data Providers assume that there will be a repeating
    Region on the page that enumerates the people and places each person in context to
    fulfill the needs of the <span class="code">PersonAddressProvider</span>. These more
    complex scenarios are fully supported by the framework.
</p>
<p>
    In general, you should write Data Providers for all of the kinds of data you want to
    be able to data bind on the server-side, and declare the data needs of each page element,
    and the framework will figure out how to supply all of the required data as efficiently
    as possible by calling the Data Provider the least number of times.
</p>
<p>
    I would highly recommend making your Data Providers granular, ie each Data Provider
    provides only one type of data, and depends on 0 or more other types of data. This
    approach will avoid your application becomming overly complex and inneficient as
    your applications grows.
