<h2>Data Provider Elements</h2>
<p>
    Data Provider elements add data to the rendering context so that
    other elements on the page can use this data.
</p>

<h2>Data Provider Class Example</h2>

<p>
    All data providers must have a C# implementation to be useful. It is not
    possible to retrieve data from somewhere and add it to the rendering
    context by decorating with attributes only.
</p>



<h2>Example of a Package Containing a Data Provider</h2>
<p>TBD</p>
