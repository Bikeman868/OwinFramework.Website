<h2>Region Elements</h2>
<p>
    Region elements define and area of a page that contains content. The content can be
    defined by a component, layout, template set, or localizable Html. The region can
    bind to a list of objects and repeat the content for each object in the list. The
    region can also introduce a new data binding scope that affects how the content
    within the region resolves its data needs.
