<h2>The <span class="code">[NeedsComponent]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a page element to specify that it has a dependency
    on a non-visual component. The framework will ensure that any page
    containing the page element will render this non-visual component onto
    the page.
</p>
<p>
    This attribute is most often used to ensure that the Javascript and CSS
    assets needed by the page element are rendered into the page.
</p>
<p>
    Note that if many elements on the page depend on the same component, then
    that component will only be included on the page once.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsRegion("address")]
[NeedsComponent("libraries:ajax")]
internal class AddressRegion { }
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[NeedsComponent()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ComponentName</span></h3>

<p>
    The name of a component that must be included on any page that includes this
    page element.  If the needed component is in a different package then you
    need to prefix the component name with the package namespace and a colon. If the
    needed component is in the same package then the namespace and colon prefix are
    not required.
</p>
