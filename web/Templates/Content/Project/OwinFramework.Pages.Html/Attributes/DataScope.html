<h2>The <span class="code">[DataScope]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    You can attach this attribute to a Page element or a Region
    element to define the scope used to retrieve a specific type
    of data.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsRegion("billing-address-region")]
[DataScope(typeof(IAddress), "billing")]
public class BillingAddressRegion
{
}

[IsRegion("delivery-address-region")]
[DataScope(typeof(IAddress), "delivery")]
public class DeliveryAddressRegion
{
}

[IsLayout("address-layout", "billing,delivery")]
[ZoneRegion("billing", "billing-address-region")]
[ZoneRegion("delivery", "delivery-address-region")]
[ZoneTemplate("billing", "/cart/invoice/address")]
[ZoneTemplate("delivery", "/cart/invoice/address")]
public class AddressLayout
{
}
</pre>
<p>
    Note that in this example the same address template is used in both
    zones of the address layout, and this template is data bound to the
    <span class="code">IAddress</span> interface, but the zones will
    contain different addresses because of the <span class="code">[DataScope]</span>
    attributes attached to the regions.
</p>
<p>
    This is an important mechanism because it allows you to reuse the address
    template with different addresses even within the same layout.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[DataScope()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">DataType</span></h3>

<p>
    This property defines the type of data to scope. The data type can be
    any reference type or any <span class="code">IList&lt;T></span> type.
</p>
<p>
    This property is required and must be passed to the constructor.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Scope</span></h3>

<p>
    Specifies the name of the scope that should be resolved below this point
    in the tree of elements on the page.
</p>
<p>
    For example if I have a page element that binds to <span class="code">PersonViewModel</span>
     with no scope name defined, this does not specify which person view model to bind
    to. In this case the framework will locate a Data Provider that is a provider of
    <span class="code">PersonViewModel</span> data and ask it to supply a 
    <span class="code">PersonViewModel</span> with no scope name defined.
</p>
<p>
    By adding a <span class="code">[DataScope()]</span> attribute to the page, or a region
    within the page, we change this behavior. Lets assune we scope the <span class="code">PersonViewModel</span>
    to <span class="code">logged-in-user</span> scope. What happens now is that the framework looks
    for a Data Provider that advertises an ability to provide <span class="code">PersonViewModel</span> in
    <span class="code">logged-in-user</span> scope, and asks it to set a <span class="code">PersonViewModel</span>
    into the data binding context in this scope.
</p>
<p>
    This mechanism allows you to create one data bound template for the <span class="code">PersonViewModel</span>
    type, and reuse this template in different contexts by setting the scope name on the container that
    contains the template.
</p>
<p>
    By setting the data scope for different regions on the same page, the page can render
    <span class="code">PersonViewModel</span> for different people on the same page using the same template.
