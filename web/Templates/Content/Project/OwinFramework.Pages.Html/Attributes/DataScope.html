<h2>The <span class="code">[DataScope]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    You can attach this attribute to a Page element or a Region
    element to define the scope used to retrieve a specific type
    of data.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsRegion("billing-address-region")]
[DataScope(typeof(IAddress), "billing")]
public class BillingAddressRegion
{
}

[IsRegion("delivery-address-region")]
[DataScope(typeof(IAddress), "delivery")]
public class DeliveryAddressRegion
{
}

[IsLayout("address-layout", "billing,delivery")]
[ZoneRegion("billing", "billing-address-region")]
[ZoneRegion("delivery", "delivery-address-region")]
[ZoneTemplate("billing", "/cart/invoice/address")]
[ZoneTemplate("delivery", "/cart/invoice/address")]
public class AddressLayout
{
}
</pre>
<p>
    Note that in this example the same address template is used in both
    zones of the address layout, and this template is data bound to the
    <span class="code">IAddress</span> interface, but the zones will 
    contain different addresses because of the <span class="code">[DataScope]</span> 
    attributes attached to the regions.
</p>
<p>
    This is an important mechanism because it allows you to reuse the address
    template with different addresses even within the same layout.
