<h2>The <span class="code">[DeployCss]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    You can attach this attribute to any visual element and it will
    cause CSS to be included in any page containing that element.
    Where the CSS will be rendered is defined by the <a href="deployedas">[DeployedAs]</a>
    attribute.
</p>
<p>
    This attribute is useful for very small amounts of CSS that is very specific to
    this element. It is recommended that larger amounts of CSS should be contained
    in a .less file instead.
</p>
<p>
    Note that even if this element is rendered many times on the pages, the CSS
    rules will only be rendered once.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>
