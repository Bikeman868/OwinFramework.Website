<title>[DeployCss] attribute | The OWIN Framework Pages</title>
<h2>The <span class="code">[DeployCss]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    You can attach this attribute to any visual element and it will
    cause CSS to be included in any page containing that element.
    Where the CSS will be rendered is defined by the <a href="deployedas">[DeployedAs]</a>
    attribute.
</p>
<p>
    This attribute is useful for very small amounts of CSS that is very specific to
    this element. It is recommended that larger amounts of CSS should be contained
    in a .less file instead.
</p>
<p>
    Note that even if this element is rendered many times on the pages, the CSS
    rules will only be rendered once.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsRegion("menu_region")]
[Container("ul", "{ns}_menu")]
[ChildContainer("li", "{ns}_menu-item")]
[DeployCss("ul.{ns}_menu", "font-size: 14px;")]
[DeployCss("li.{ns}_menu-item", "font-size: 12px;")]
public class MenuRegion
{
}
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[DeployCss()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">CssSelector</span></h3>

<p>
    This property can contain any valid CSS selector for the style. If you are
    using package namespaces (recommended) then you can have the appropriate
    namespace prefix added to class names by putting the spacial
    <span class="code">{ns}_</span> marker directly in front of CSS class names.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">CssStyle</span></h3>

<p>
    Defines the style to apply to elements that match the selector.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Order</span></h3>

<p>
    CSS rules are rendered in order of lowest to highest value for the
    <span class="code">Order</span> property. This property defaults
    to zero for <span class="code">[DeployCss()]</span> attributes that
    do not specify the value to use.
</p>
