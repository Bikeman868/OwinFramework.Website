<h2>The <span class="code">[Route]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[Route]</span> attribute adds an entry in the routing table
    that directs matching requests to this page. A page can have as many <span class="code">[Route]</span> attributes
    as it likes, in which case you should consider specifying the canonical Url for the page to avoid penalties
    from search engines.
