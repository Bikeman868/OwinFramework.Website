<title>[Route] attribute | The OWIN Framework Pages</title>
<h2>The <span class="code">[Route]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[Route]</span> attribute adds an entry in the routing table
    that directs matching requests to this page. A page can have as many <span class="code">[Route]</span> attributes
    as it likes, in which case you should consider specifying the canonical Url for the page to avoid penalties
    from search engines.
</p>

<h2>Example usage</h2>
<pre>
[IsPage("home", "/")]
[Route("/", Method.Get)]
[Route("/home", Method.Get)]
[UsesLayout("home")]
internal class HomePage { }
</pre>

<h2><span class="code">[Route()]</span> attribute properties</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[Route()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Path</span></h3>
<p>
    When users navigate to a Url with this path, then this page will be
    rendered in response. The path should always be absolute, i.e. start with
    a forward slash.
</p>
<p>
    For dynamic pages the <span class="code">[Route()]</span> attribute can
    contain wildcards. Wildcards make the page render for a whole set of Urls.
    In this case the components on the page should contain code to render
    different content for the various paths that match the wildcard, or
    the Data Providers referenced by the page elements should put different
    data into the rendering context based on the path of the Url.
</p>
<p>
    The wildcard character is <span class="code">*</span>. It can be used
    in place of an element in the path to indicate that anything can appear
    in this part of the path. For example I can set the <span class="code">Path</span>
    property to <span class="code">/customer/*/orders</span> to indicate that
    this page is only rendered if the first element of the path is
    <span class="code">customer</span> and the third element of the path is
    <span class="code">orders</span>, but the second element of the path can
    contain anything. In this case the components and/or data providers for
    the page should examine the second path element to determine which
    customer to display orders for.
</p>
<p>
    You can also tell the router to ignore the rest of the path by appending
    <span class="code">**</span> to the end of the path. For example if I
    set the <span class="code">Path</span> property to <span class="code">/customer/order/**</span>
    then this page will be rendered for any Url that starts with <span class="code">/customer/order/</span>
    irrespective of the rest of the path.
</p>
<div class="app_warning">
    Note that you cannot use the <span class="code">*</span> wildcard to match part
    of a string. This limitation exists for efficiency. Remember that every request
    is compared to all of the routes until a match is found. Performing complex
    wildcard matches would make the webisite not scalable.
</div>

<h3><span class="code">Methods</span></h3>
<p>
    This property of the <span class="code">[Route()]</span>
    attribute defines the Http methods that will be routed to the
    page. If you do not specify the <span class="code">Methods</span>
    it will default to <span class="code">new []{ Method.Get }</span>. In this
    case the page will only be rendered in response to Http GET requests.
</p>
<p>
    You can route all Http methods to the page by setting
    <span class="code">Methods</span> to an empty
    array like this: <span class="code">new Method[]{ }</span>
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Priority</span></h3>
<p>
    This property of the <span class="code">[Route()]</span>
    attribute defines the order in which routing will be evaluated.
    The highest priority routes are considered before the lower priority ones.
    Since the default priority is zero, the recommentation is to make very
    specific routes have positive priorities and wildcard routes have negative
    priority so that the wildcard routes do not mask the more specific routes
    by matching the request first.
</p>
<p>
    Priorities also affect performance because the router will try to match
    routes in order or highest to lowest priority until it finds a match.
    You can make routing more efficient by giving higher priority to routes
    that are matched more frequently.
</p>
