<h2>The <span class="code">[IsModule]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a class to identify it as a module.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsModule("content", AssetDeployment.InPage)]
internal class ContentModule 
{ }

[IsComponent("defaultStyles")]
[DeployedAs("content")]
internal class DefaultStylesComponent 
{ }
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[IsModule()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Name</span></h3>

<p>
    You will want to choose a unique name for your module to make it useful.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">AssetDeployment</span></h3>

<p>
    This defines the asset deployment mechanism to use for all elements assigned 
    to this module.
</p>
<p>
    The possible values for the <span class="code">AssetDeployment</span> property are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="code">Inherit</span> means that page element will interit
        the <span class="code">AssetDeployment</span> property of the containing page
        element. If all elements on a page are set to <span class="code">Inherit</span>
        (which is the default) then they all follow the asset deployment mechanism set
        in the page. Pages default to <span class="code">PerWebsite</span>, so by default
        all Javascript and all CSS for the entire website will be combined into a single
        asset.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="code">InPage</span> means that page element will write its
        CSS and Javascript directly into the <span class="code">&lt;head></span> section
        of the page. This option is mainly useful for debugging and generating html for
        emails.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="code">PerPage</span> means that each page will have a Javascript and
        CSS asset that is specific to that page and contains everything that that page
        needs to render. If the same page element is used on multiple pages then its
        CSS and Javascript will be duplicated in all the page specific assets for the
        pages where it is referenced. This option means that the page will only reference
        exactly what it needs, but the browser will have to fetch the assets associated
        with every page that the user visits.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="code">PerModule</span> means that the element should use the
        <span class="code">AssetDeployment</span> property of the module it is in.
        You can also specify this module by name with the <span class="code">[DeployedAs]</span>
        attribute.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="code">PerWebsite</span> means that there is a single Javascript
        and CSS asset for the entire website and this element will write its CSS and
        Javascript into this global asset.
    </li>
</ul>
