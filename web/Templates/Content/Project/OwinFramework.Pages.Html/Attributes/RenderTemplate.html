<h2>The <span class="code">[RenderTemplate]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    One or more <span class="code">[RenderTemplate]</span> attributes can be attached
    to a region to render templates into various parts of the page. For example you can
    create a template for some part of the page head and use a <span class="code">[RenderTemplate]</span>
    attribute on a region to specify that this template should be rendered into the
    <span class="code">&lt;head></span> area of the page.
</p>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[RenderTemplate()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">TemplatePath</span></h3>
<p>
    Defines the path of the template to render. Template paths look like Url paths,
    but they are references to the location of a template within the template
    folder structure.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">PageArea</span></h3>
<p>
    Defines the area of the page where the template should be rendered. This makes
    the most sense for templates that only have one part. It is also possible to
    create multi-part templates that already render content into multiple places
    on the page. How these will interact with this setting depends on the behavior 
    of the template parser, and is generally not recommended.
