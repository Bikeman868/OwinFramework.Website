<h2>The <span class="code">[IsPage]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a class to identify it as a webpage.
    To register this page with the router and send requests to it you must get the
    fluent builder to scan the assembly containing your class.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
    [IsPage]
    [Route("/", Method.Get)]
    [UsesLayout("homePageLayout")]
    internal class HomePage { }
</pre>

<h2>Example Startup Code</h2>

<pre>
    var fluentBuilder = ninject.Get&lt;IFluentBuilder>();
    fluentBuilder.Register(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), t => ninject.Get(t));
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[IsPage()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Name</span></h3>

<p>
    You do not have to choose a name for your page, but it makes sense to do so for debugging purposes.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">CanonicalUrl</span></h3>

<p>
    If there is more than one URL that returns this page's content, then you are
    strongly advised to set the <span class="code">CanonicalUrl</span> property. This
    tells search engines that you deliberately made more than one URL for the page
    and tells the search engine which one to direct trafic to.
</p>
<p>
    If you have multiple URLs for a page and do not set the <span class="code">CanonicalUrl</span>
    property then the page rank will be significantly reduced by the search engines.
</p>
