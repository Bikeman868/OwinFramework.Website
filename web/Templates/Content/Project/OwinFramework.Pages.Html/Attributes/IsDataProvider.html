<title>[IsDataProvider] attribute | The OWIN Framework Pages</title>
<h2>The <span class="code">[IsDataProvider]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a class to identify it as a data provider.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsDataProvider("customer", typeof(Customer))]
internal class CustomerDataProvider : DataProvider
{
    public CustomerDataProvider(IDataProviderDependenciesFactory dependencies) 
        : base(dependencies)
    {
    }

    protected override void Supply(
        IRenderContext renderContext,
        IDataContext dataContext,
        IDataDependency dependency)
    {
        dataContext.Set(new Customer());
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[IsDataProvider()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Name</span></h3>

<p>
    You can explicitly name your data providers and define data dependencies using
    these names, however this is not the most common use case because specifying
    data needs in terms of the type of data is much more powerful and flexible.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you are not using the name of the data provider to define data needs,
    it's still a good idea to set it because it will make diagnostic traces and
    debug information more meaningful.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Type</span></h3>

<p>
    Defines the type of data that this data provider can provide. This must be
    either a C# class type, or an <span class="code">IList&lt;T></span> type.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Scope</span></h3>

<p>
    Specifies a scope name. When this is set, this data provider will only be
    considered as the supplier of data when the page element specifies that
    it needs data in this specific scope.
</p>
<p>
    When the scope name is not set, this means that this data provider can
    provide this kind of data for all scopes. In this case this data provider
    will only be used if there are no scope specific data providers that match
    the request.
</p>
<p>
    In the case where there are multiple data providers that can provide the
    data, the one that will be selected depends on what other data is required
    on the page, and the other types of data that each provider can provide.
