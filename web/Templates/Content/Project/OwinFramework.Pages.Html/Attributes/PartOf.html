<h2>The <span class="code">[PartOf]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[PartOf]</span> attribute can be attached to any
    page element that can produce Css and Javascript assets. The
    <span class="code">[PartOf]</span> attribute defines the namespace to use
    for these assets to ensure that names of Css classes and Javascript functions
    do not conflict.
</p>
<p>
    Unless you are writing a very large application, you will likely use only
    one package for all of your application code.
</p>
<p>
    If you are creating a reusable package for distribution to application
    developers then you must put all of your elements into packages so that
    the application developer can choose a namespace for each package and avoid
    naming conflicts between imported packages.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[PartOf()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">PackageName</span></h3>
<p>
    The name of the <a href="../elements/package">Package</a> that defines the namespace for
    assets belonging to this page element.
</p>
<p>
    This is also used in name resolution for any attributes attached to this element.
    For example if this element refers to layouts, regions, components etc by name
    then these names will be resolved within the scope of the package. To refer to
    elements from other packages, prefix the element name with the namespace of the
    package and a colon.
