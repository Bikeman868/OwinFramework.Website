<h2>The <span class="code">[PartOf]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[PartOf]</span> attribute can be attached to any
    page element that can produce Css and Javascript assets. The 
    <span class="code">[PartOf]</span> attribute defines the namespace to use
    for these assets to ensure that names of Css classes and Javascript functions
    do not conflict.

<p>
    Unless you are writing a very large application, you will likely use only
    one package for all of your application code.
</p>
<p>
    If you are creating a reusable package for distribution to application
    developers then you must put all of your elements into packages so that
    the application developer can choose a namespace for each package and avoid
    naming conflicts between imported packages.
