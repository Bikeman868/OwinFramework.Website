<h2>The <span class="code">[IsPackage]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a class to identify it as a package.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsPackage("application", "app")]
internal class ApplicationPackage { }

[IsComponent("defaultStyles")]
[PartOf("application")]
internal class DefaultStylesComponent 
{ }
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[IsPackage()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Name</span></h3>

<p>
    You will want to choose a unique name for your package if you intend to assign
    other page elements to it using attributes. If you are creating a package for
    distribution to third parties then you don't have to set a package name, but
    it makes sense to do so for debugging purposes.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">NamespaceName</span></h3>

<p>
    This defines the prefix to use on all CSS class names and the namespace
    used to enclose all Javascript functions. You must choose a name that is
    valid syntax when applied to a CSS class name as a prefix and is also
    a valid Javascript identifier. I recommend choosing a short all lower case
    name with no puncuation or special characters. If you need to concatenate
    multiple words then you should separate them with underscore because hyphens
    look like subtraction to the Javascript parser.
