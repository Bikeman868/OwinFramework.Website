<h2>The <span class="code">[IsLayout]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a class to identify it as a layout.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsPage]
[Route("/", Method.Get)]
[UsesLayout("homePageLayout")]
internal class HomePage { }

[IsLayout("homePageLayout", "zone1")]
[ZoneHtml("zone1", "hello-world", "Hello, world")]
internal class HomePageLayout { }
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[IsLayout()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Name</span></h3>

<p>
    If you want to refer to your layout by name in other page elements, then
    you need to provide a unique name here. The name will be scoped by the
    package it is in, so the name only has to be unique within the package.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to refer to this layout by name from a page element that is in
    a different package, then you need to prefix the layout name with the
    package prefix and a colon, for example <span class="code">"layouts:two_column"</span>
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ZoneNesting</span></h3>

<p>
    This property defines the names of the zones within the layout and also
    how these are nested in child containers.
</p>
<p>
    For example if I set my <span class="code">ZoneNesting</span> property to
    <span class="code">zone1,zone2</span> and I chose <span class="code">ul</span> 
    as my container tag, then I will get Html like this:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;ul>
    // Contents of zone1
    // Contents of zone2
&lt;/ul>
</pre>

<p>
    If I introduce a third zone, group it with zone 2 like this
    <span class="code">zone1(zone2,zone3)</span> and choose <span class="code">li</span> 
    as my child container tag, then I will get Html like this:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;ul>
    // Contents of zone1
    &lt;li>
        // Contents of zone2
        // Contents of zone3
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
</pre>
<p>
    You can nest zones as deeply as you want.
</p>
<p>
    If you want the layout to render some different nesting of containers,
    or render some zones multiple times or any other specific behavior, 
    then you need to make your Layout class class inherit
    from the built-in <span class="code">Layout</span> class as described
    in the <a href="../elements/layout">Layout element documentation</a>
