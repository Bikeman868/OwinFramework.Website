<h2>The <span class="code">[Style]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[Style]</span> attribute can be used with page elements
    that write containers. This renderes a custom style directly onto the container
    DOM element.
</p>
<p>
    This attribute is provided for completeness and it not expected to be used very much.
    Rather that attaching style information directly to elements, you should consider
    using Css instead.
</p>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[Style()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">CssStyle</span></h3>
