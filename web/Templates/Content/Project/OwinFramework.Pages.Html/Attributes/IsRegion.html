<title>[IsRegion] attribute | The OWIN Framework Pages</title>
<h2>The <span class="code">[IsRegion]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a class to identify it as a region.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsRegion("addres_list")]
[Repeat(typeof(Person))]
[NeedsData("person_address")]
internal class AddressListRegion
{ }
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[IsRegion()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Name</span></h3>

<p>
    If you want to refer to your region by name in other page elements, then
    you need to provide a unique name here. The name will be scoped by the
    package it is in, so the name only has to be unique within the package.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to refer to this region by name from a page element that is in
    a different package, then you need to prefix the region name with the
    package prefix and a colon, for example <span class="code">"regions:address_region"</span>
</p>
