<h2>The <span class="code">[RenderHtml]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[RenderHtml]</span> attribute can be attached
    to a component or region to define the contents of that cmponent or
    region is localizable static Html.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[RenderHtml()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">TextName</span></h3>
<p>
    This name is passed to the localization system to retrieve the locale
    specific version of the Html to write. Every piece of localized text
    must have a unique name, so you should come up with a naming convention
    that makes this manageable.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Html</span></h3>
<p>
    This default Html to render when there is no locale specific version of
    the Html configured in the localization system.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Order</span></h3>
<p>
    .Net does not preserve the order of attributes attached to classes, but
    the order of rendering Html is obviously important in the case where
    multiple <span class="code">[RenderHtml()]</span> attributes have been
    attached to an element.
</p>
<p>
    This property is required when there are multiple <span class="code">[RenderHtml()]</span> 
    attributes attached to an element to define the order in which they will be rendered.
</p>
