<h2>The <span class="code">[SuppliesData]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[SuppliesData]</span> attribute can be attached to data providers
    that provide multiple kinds of data, or the same data in multiple data scopes.
</p>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[SuppliesData()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">DataType</span></h3>
<p>
    Defines ab additional type of data that this data provider can provide. This must be
    either a C# class type, or an <span class="code">IList&lt;T></span> type.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Scope</span></h3>

<p>
    Specifies a scope name. When this is set, this data provider will only be
    considered as the supplier of data when the page element specifies that
    it needs data in this specific scope.
</p>
<p>
    When the scope name is not set, this means that this data provider can
    provide this kind of data for all scopes. In this case this data provider
    will only be used if there are no scope specific data providers that match
    the request.
</p>
<p>
    In the case where there are multiple data providers that can provide the
    data, the one that will be selected depends on what other data is required
    on the page, and the other types of data that each provider can provide.
