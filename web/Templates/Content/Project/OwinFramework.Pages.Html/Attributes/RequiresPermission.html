<h2>The <span class="code">[RequiresPermission]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[RequiresPermission]</span> attribute specifies the name
    of a permission that must be assigned to the calling identity. If the caller
    does not have this permission, then the caller will receive an access denied response.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[RequiresPermission()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">PermissionName</span></h3>
<p>
    Specifies the name of the permission to check. This permission must be configured
    in the Authorization middleware to be effective. If you do not configure any
    Authorization middleware then this permission will not be checked and all users
    will be able to access this page.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ResourcePath</span></h3>
<p>
    Defines the optional path of the secure resource. See documentation on the 
    <a href="/content/area/authorization/landing">Authorization sub-system</a> to 
    understand how to set this property.
