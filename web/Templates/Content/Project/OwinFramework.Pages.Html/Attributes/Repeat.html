<h2>The <span class="code">[Repeat]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[Repeat]</span> attribute can only be used with a
    <a href="../elements/region">Region element</a>. It instructs the region to repeat
    its content for each object in a list of objects. If the content tree inside the
    region binds to the object type that is repeated, then it will bind to the properties
    of a different object in the list on each iteration.
