<title>[Repeat] attribute | The OWIN Framework Pages</title>
<h2>The <span class="code">[Repeat]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[Repeat]</span> attribute can only be used with a
    <a href="../elements/region">Region element</a>. It instructs the region to repeat
    its content for each object in a list of objects. If the content tree inside the
    region binds to the object type that is repeated, then it will bind to the properties
    of a different object in the list on each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    The <span class="code">[Repeat()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">RepeatType</span></h3>
<p>
    Specifies the type of data that should be repeated within the Region. Setting
    this property implies that the region needs <span class="code">IList&lt;T></span> data,
    and this does not have to be explicitly defined using the
    <a href="needsdata"><span class="code">[NeedsData()]</span> attribute</a>
</p>
<p>
    You will need to write a <a href="../elements/dataprovider">Data Provider</a> that can provide
    <span class="code">IList&lt;T></span> data for this to work.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">RepeatScope</span></h3>
<p>
    Provides additional constraints on the <span class="code">RepeatType</span> property
    by specifying that the <a href="../elements/dataprovider">Data Provider</a> will be
    asked to provide <span class="code">IList&lt;T></span> data in this scope.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ListScope</span></h3>
<p>
    As the Region repeats its content for each <span class="code">T</span> in the
    <span class="code">IList&lt;T></span> that it depends on, it will insert the object
    of type <span class="code">T</span> into the rendering context so that each time the
    region is repeated it binds to a different instance of <span class="code">T</span>
    and renders different content just as you would expect.
</p>
<p>
    The <span class="code">ListScope</span> property specifies the scope name to use when
    setting values of type <span class="code">T</span> into the render context before
    rendering the contents of the region.
</p>
<p>
    This is a fairly advanced use case that alows you to for example render two different
    instances of the same type within the region where one of them is the repeated data
    and the other was added to the render context higher up the element tree.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ChildTag</span></h3>
<p>
    Defines an Html container element to wrap around each instance of the region's content.
    For example you might want to render the region with each repetition of the region's
    content contained in a <span class="code">li</span> element.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ChildClassNames</span></h3>
<p>
    Setting this property adds a <span span="code">class</span> attribute to
    the container that is rendered around each child element.
</p>
<p>
    You can include multiple class names separated by spaces.
</p>
<p>
    If you are using CSS prefixes for package namespaces (recommended) then you
    can add the appropriate package namespace prefix to your class names by
    using the special <span class="code">{ns}_</span> marker in front of each
    class name that you want to be prefixed.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ChildStyle</span></h3>
<p>
    This property contains the style definition to attach to each child container.
</p>
