<h2>The <span class="code">[NeedsData]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a page element to specify that it has a dependency
    on some data. The framework will locate a suitable data provided and bind
    it to any page containing this page element.
</p>
<p>
    Note that if many elements on the page depend on the same data, then
    the data provider will only be called once on the page and all of the 
    page elements can bind to the same data.
</p>
<p>
    Note that you can use regions to resolve data needs at the region level
    instead of at the page level allowing the same type of data to resolve to
    different records in different parts of the page.
</p>
<p>
    You can also attach this <span class="code">[NeedsData]</span> attribute
    to a data provider to create a heirachy of data providers that depend on
    each other. For example the data provider that provides a list of invoices
    can have a dependency on the data provider that provides customer data.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsRegion("address")]
[NeedsData(typeof(Address))]
internal class AddressRegion { }
</pre>
