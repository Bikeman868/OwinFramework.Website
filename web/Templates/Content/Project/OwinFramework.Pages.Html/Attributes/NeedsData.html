<h2>The <span class="code">[NeedsData]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    Attach this attribute to a page element to specify that it has a dependency
    on some data. The framework will locate a suitable data provided and bind
    it to any page containing this page element.
</p>
<p>
    Note that if many elements on the page depend on the same data, then
    the data provider will only be called once on the page and all of the
    page elements can bind to the same data.
</p>
<p>
    Note that you can use regions to resolve data needs at the region level
    instead of at the page level allowing the same type of data to resolve to
    different records in different parts of the page.
</p>
<p>
    You can also attach this <span class="code">[NeedsData]</span> attribute
    to a data provider to create a heirachy of data providers that depend on
    each other. For example the data provider that provides a list of invoices
    can have a dependency on the data provider that provides customer data.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsRegion("address")]
[NeedsData(typeof(Address))]
internal class AddressRegion { }
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[NeedsData()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">DataProviderName</span></h3>
<p>
    This allows you to define a dependency on a specific <a href="../Elements/dataprovider">Data Provider</a> using the
    name property of the data provider. If the data provider is in a different
    package then the name must be prefixed by the package namespace and a colon.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">DataType</span></h3>
<p>
    Defines a type of data that this element needs to be available at runtime
    when rendering the page. The framework will locate an appropriate
    <a href="../Elements/dataprovider">Data Provider</a> based on the other
    data needs and the <a href="../Elements/dataprovider">Data Providers</a> that
    are defined within the application.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Scope</span></h3>
<p>
    This places additional constraits on the <a href="../Elements/dataprovider">Data Provider</a>
    selection. If there is a <a href="../Elements/dataprovider">Data Provider</a> that specified
    that is can supply this type of data in this scope then it will be selected. If there are
    no matching Data Providers, then Data Providers will be matched based on data type only.
