<h2>The <span class="code">[DeployFunction]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    You can attach one or more of these attributes to any visual element and it will
    cause a Javascript function to be included in any page containing that element.
    Where the Javascript will be rendered is defined by the <a href="deployedas">[DeployedAs]</a>
    attribute.
</p>
<p>
    This attribute is useful for very small amounts of Javascript that is very specific to
    this element. It is recommended that larger amounts of Javascript should be contained
    in a Javascript file instead.
</p>
<p>
    Note that even if this element is rendered many times on the pages, the Javascript
    function will only be rendered once.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsComponent("my-component")]
[PartOf("application")]
[DeployedAs("content")]
[DeployFunction(null, "sayHello", null, "alert('Hello');")]
internal class MyComponent { }
</pre>

<p>
    The <span class="code">[DeployFunction()]</span> attribute has the following
    properties you can set.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">FunctionName</span></h3>

<p>
    Must be a syntactically valid Javascript function name that is unique within the 
    package namespace. The namespace is defined by the <a href="../attributes/partof"><span class="code">[PartOf()]</span> attribute</a>
    attached to the element.
</p>
<p>
    This function can be called directly from any other function in the same
    package namespace. To call this function from another namespace the
    function name must be qualified with the <span class="code">ns.{namespace}.</span> 
    prefix, where <span class="code">{namespace}</span> is the namespace of the
    package containing the function you want to call.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">ReturnType</span></h3>

<p>
    The type of data returned by the function is provided here for documentation only.
    Javascript does not have strong typing, so this property has no impact on the execution
    of the function.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Parameters</span></h3>

<p>
    This is a comma separated list of parameters that can be passed to the function.
    Note that all parameter values are optional in Javascript.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">Body</span></h3>

<p>
    This is the body of the Javascript function. You do not need to enclose this in
    curly braces, these will be added automatically.
</p>

<h3><span class="code">IsPublic</span></h3>

<p>
    Setting this value to <span class="code">false</span> will make this function only
    visible within the namespace where it is defined.
</p>
