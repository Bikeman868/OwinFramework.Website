<h2>The <span class="code">[DeployFunction]</span> Attribute</h2>
<p>
    You can attach one or more of these attributes to any visual element and it will
    cause a Javascript function to be included in any page containing that element.
    Where the Javascript will be rendered is defined by the <a href="deployedas">[DeployedAs]</a>
    attribute.
</p>
<p>
    This attribute is useful for very small amounts of Javascript that is very specific to
    this element. It is recommended that larger amounts of Javascript should be contained
    in a Javascript file instead.
</p>
<p>
    Note that even if this element is rendered many times on the pages, the Javascript
    function will only be rendered once.
</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
[IsComponent("my-component")]
[PartOf("application")]
[DeployedAs("content")]
[DeployFunction(null, "sayHello", null, "alert('Hello');")]
internal class MyComponent { }
</pre>
