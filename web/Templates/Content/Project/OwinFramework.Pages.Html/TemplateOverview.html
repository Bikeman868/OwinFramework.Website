<title>Template system overview | The OWIN Framework</title>
<h2>The templating system</h2>

<p>
    Templates are a really important concept in building a website using this framework. Writing classes 
    and decorating them with attributes to define pages, layouts, regions etc is very powerful and flexible, 
    especially when those classes inherit from the standard implementation and override some of the virtual 
    methods, but this technique has two important drawbacks: All of the website content is compiled into the 
    asemblies which means you need to recompile and redepoly to change anything; Writing html and Javascript 
    as strings that are passed to attribute constructors is ugly, and you don't get any help from the 
    development tool (syntax highlighting and intellisense).
</p>
<p>
    The templating system addresses these two issues by allowing you to place snippets of html, css and Javascript
    into separate resources then referencing them from region and layout elements.
</p>

<h3>Template Loaders</h3>

<p>
    You can easily write your own template loader, or you can use one of the ones that are provided as standard.
    The job of the template loader is to retrieve templates from somewhere and pass them to a template parser,
    then optionally register them with the Name Manager.
</p>
<p>
    The template loaders that are included in the standard package are:
</p>

<h4>OwinFramework.Pages.Html.Templates.FileSystemLoader</h4>

<p>
    This template loader scans files in a directory within the file system, loads files and parses them
    then adds the parsed template to the name manager. When registering templates it maps the file path
    onto the template path using two configuration options that define the root of the folder tree
    and the root of the template path heirachy. By default the <span class="code">FileSystemLoader</span> 
    loads template files from a <span class="code">~\Templates</span> folder and maps them onto the root
    of the template path heirachy. What this means is that if you have a template file in 
    <span class="code">~\Templates\Profile\MyProfile.html</span> this will be registered with the name
    manager as the <span class="code">/profile/myprofile</span> template. Template paths are not case
    sensitive so you can also refer to this template as <span class="code">/Profile/MyProfile</span>
    if you like.
</p>
<div class="information">
    Note that the Windows file system uses backslashes in folder paths but template paths use forward slash
    so the <span class="code">FileSystemLoader</span> replaces backslash with forward slash when registering
    templates in the name manager.
</div>
<div class="information">
    Note that <span class="code">FileSystemLoader</span> does not include the file extension when registering
    templates with the name manager. This is useful if you use the file extension to determine which parser
    to use and want to be able to switch parser without updating all references to the template.
</div>
<p>
    The folder to scan, whether to include sub-folders or not, the mapping of file path onto the parser
    to use and periodic checking and reloading of templates are all configurable. When reloading is
    enabled the file system loader will calculate a hash for each template and only re-parse and re-register
    templates when the hash changes.
</p>
<p>
    Below is an example of how to use the <span class="code">/span> FileSystemLoader</span>. The full
    source code that this was taken from can be seen 
    <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/OwinFramework.Website/blob/master/web/Startup.cs">here</a>.
</p>
<pre>
var fileLoader = ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Pages.Html.Templates.FileSystemLoader>();
fileLoader.Load(markdownParser, p => p.Value.EndsWith(".md"));
fileLoader.Load(asIsParser, p => p.Value.EndsWith(".html"));
fileLoader.Load(mustacheParser, p => p.Value.EndsWith(".mustache"));
</pre>

<h4>OwinFramework.Pages.Html.Templates.UriLoader</h4>

<p>
    This template loader takes a URI that defines a template location, downloads the content from that
    URI, passes the content to a template parser and registers the template with the name manager.
    The Uri loader can also be configured to download the content periodically in which case it will 
    calculate a checksum and only reparse and reregister the template if the checksum has changed.
</p>
<p>
    Below is an example of how to use the <span class="code">/span> FileSystemLoader</span>. The full
    source code that this was taken from can be seen
    <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/OwinFramework.Website/blob/master/web/Startup.cs">here</a>.
</p>
<pre>
var uriLoader = ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Pages.Html.Templates.UriLoader>();
uriLoader.ReloadInterval = TimeSpan.FromHours(6);

foreach (var project in SiteMap.Instance.Projects)
{
    var repository = project.Repository;
    var repositoryName = repository.GitHubRepositoryName;
    var ownerName = repository.Owner.GitHubAccountName;
    var uri = new Uri("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/" + ownerName + "/" + repositoryName + "/master/" + project.ProjectName + "/readme.md");
    var templatePath = "/content/project/" + project.ProjectName + "/readme";
    uriLoader.LoadUri(uri, markdownParser, templatePath);
}
</pre>

<div class="information">
    I strongly recommend using forward slash in template paths as shown in the above example but this
    is not required by the framework.
</div>

<h3>Template Parsers</h3>

<p>
    Template parsers are responsible for taking a text document and turning it into an 
    <span class="code">ITemplate</span> implementation. You can write your own template
    parser and use it with any of the template loaders or you can use the built-in template 
    parsers.
</p>
<p>
    If you are writing your own parser you don't need to implement <span class="code">ITemplate</span>,
    you just need to make your parser have an injected dependency on <span class="code">ITemplateBuilder</span> 
    and use it to build your templates. Take a look at the source code for the <span class="code">AsIsParser</span>
    to see how simple this can be.
</p>

<h4>OwinFramework.Pages.Html.Templates.AsIsParser</h4>

<p>
    This template parser does very little and yet is one of the most useful parsers.
    It simply takes the original text of the template resource and writes it directly
    into the page at runtime.
</p>
<p>
    You can use this template parser whenever you have literal content in your
    template that you want to be directly inserted into the page content
    without any additional processing.
</p>

<h4>OwinFramework.Pages.Html.Templates.MarkdownParser</h4>

<p>
    This template parser assumes that the template contains static text in
    markdown format. It parses the markdown and converts it into Html, then
    outputs the Html into the page each time the template is rendered.
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="templates/markdownparser">more details</a> about the markdown template parser.
</p>

<h4>OwinFramework.Pages.Html.Templates.MustacheParser</h4>

<p>
    This template parser assumes that the template contains html with data
    binding expressions in Mustache format. The data binding expressions will
    be replaced with data from the rendering context each time the template
    is rendered. You will need to add data providers to your solution to
    provide the data that is referenced in the data binding expressions.
</p>
<p>
    See <a href="templates/mustacheparser">more details</a> about the mustache template parser.
</p>

<h4>OwinFramework.Pages.Html.Templates.MultiPartParser</h4>

<p>
    This template parser allows you to combine content from various parts of
    the page into a single template resource using a special separator between
    sections. For example you can combine CSS, html and Javascript templates
    into a single file and the <span class="code">MultiPartParser</span> will
    separate out the different areas and render them into different parts of
    the page.
</p>

<p>
    See <a href="templates/multipartparser">more details</a> about the multi-part template parser.
</p>

<h3>Building Templates Directly</h3>
<p>
    Instead of using a loader to load template files then applying a parser to
    create the template, it is also possible to use the <span class="code">ITemplateBuilder</span>
    to directly construct templates within your application. This is illustrated below:
</p>
<pre>
var templateBuilder = ninject.Get&lt;ITemplateBuilder>();
var template = templateBuilder.BuildUpTemplate()
      .AddElementOpen("p", "class", "dummy")
      .AddText("this-is-the", "This is the ")
      .AddDataField<applicationinfo>(a => a.Name)
      .AddText("application", " application")
      .AddElementClose()
      .Build();
  nameManager.Register(template, "/demo/template1");
</pre>

<h3>Populating Layouts and Pages with Templates</h3>

<p>
    Layouts and pages can have a <span class="code">[ZoneTemplate]</span> attribute
    attached to the class to specify a template to render into a named region of the 
    layout. When you do this for a template with a single part, the template will be 
    rendered into the body of the page. If you do this with a multi-part template then
    it will be rendered into all parts of the page that are templated.
</p>

<h3>Populating Regions with Templates</h3>

<p>
    To populate a region with templates attach one or more <span class="code">[RenderTemplate]</span>
    attributes to it. Each attribute specifies a template path and the area of the
    page to render the template into.
</p>
<div class="warning">
    Note that this technique only works with single-part templates. You can only
    attack one multi-part template and it already defines the page areas within
    the template itself.
</div>
<p>
    Lets say for example I want to create a login form. The login form consists of
    some html, some CSS and some Javascript. It is convenient to create three separate
    templates because your development tool will provide syntax highlighting and
    intellisense within each file according to the type of content. These three
    templates need to be written to different parts of the page. You might
    create a region like the one below to accomplish this:
</p>
<pre>
[IsRegion("login-form")]
[RenderTemplate("/forms/loginStyle", PageArea.Styles)]
[RenderTemplate("/forms/loginLayout", PageArea.Body)]
[RenderTemplate("/forms/loginModel", PageArea.Initialization)]
internal class LoginFormRegion { }
</pre>

<h3>Multi-part vs Single Part Templates</h3>

<p>
    Most template parsers take a text file, parse it into some html and then write
    that html into the body of the page when the page is rendered These are referred
    to as single part templates in this documentation. It is also possible to create
    templates that write different content into different parts of the page, i.e they
    can write styles and scripts into the head, html into the body and initialization
    scripts at the bottom of the page. These are referred to as multi-part templates.
</p>
<p>
    When a single part template is rendered into a page or layout then it will always
    be rendered into the body of the page. In contrast the region provides more flexibility
    by allowing you to specify which part of the page you want to render into. The region
    also allows you to choose different templates to render into each part of the page. This
    is especially useful when creating self-contained reuasble pieces of UI functionallity
    because you can create different templates for the CSS Javascript and Html (possibly
    using different parsers) and combine these into a single region element by writing the
    templates into the appropriate places in the page.
</p>
<p>
    If you want even more flexibility than regions provide, then you can create a component
    that can retrieve as many templates as you like from the name manager and render 
    them however you want. This website it a good example of this technique; it has a component
    that maps the URL of the page onto the path of a template and renders that template making
    it possible to add new pages to the website just by adding new templates. Take a 
    look at the <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/OwinFramework.Website/blob/master/web/Components/ContentTemplate.cs">source code</a> 
    to see how this works.
