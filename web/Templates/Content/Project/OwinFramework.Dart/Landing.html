<p>
    This middleware will serve a UI written in Dart. Dart is a Google language that
    compiles to Javascript for older browsers that can not run Dart code natively. 
    This middleware detects browsers that support Dart natively and serves Dart code 
    to them and compiled Javascript otherwise.

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Dart.DartMiddleware>())
    .As("Dart")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/dart");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the 
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "dart": {
            "documentationRootUrl": "/config/dart",
            "uiRootUrl": "/ui",
            "dartUiRootUrl": "/ui/web",

}</pre>

<div class="app_hint">
    Note that when you compile your Dart application with the pub tool it will copy
    the compiled version of your Dart code to <span class="code">\ui\build\web</span> so everything will work
    right out of the box.
