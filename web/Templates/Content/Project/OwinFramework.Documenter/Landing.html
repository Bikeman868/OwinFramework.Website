    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "documenter": {
            "path": "/owin/endpoints",
            "enabled": true,
            "requiredPermission": null,
            "localFilePath ": ""
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<h2>Configuration Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The "path" configuration specifies the relative URL within your web site
        where the documentation will be available at run-time. If you are using
        routes in your Owin pipeline then you must make sure that the documenter
        middleware is on a route where it will receive requests for this URL.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a publically accessible website you probably do not want to expose
        documentation for all of the endpoints unless this is a public API and
        you actually want to supply end users with documentation. To disable in
        production either set the "enabled" property to false, or configure
        Identification and Authorization middleware then set the "requiredPermission"
        to the name of a permission that users must have to see the documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The "localFilePath" specifies a location on the file system where you
        placed an alternate set of templates. If you do not provide any templates
        then the built-in ones will be used by default. The built-in templates are
        embedded into the assembly so their are no additional files to deploy.
    </li>
</ul>
