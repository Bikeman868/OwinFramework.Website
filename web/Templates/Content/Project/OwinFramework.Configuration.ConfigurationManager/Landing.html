<p>
    The Microsoft <span class="code">ConfigurationManager</span> is extremely inflexible which means that when
    you configure the 'path' of the configuration data for your middleware this must
    be the name of a custom section in the config file.
</p>
<p>    
    The Microsoft<span class="code">ConfigurationManager</span> requires each custom section to be backed 
    by a class that conforms to strict patterns. These classes are very onerous to write so this 
    framework does not require middleware authors to write them, and this means that it falls to your
    application to do this. Additionally the class that backs the custom section will not be
    the class that the middleware component is expecting to contain its configuration
    options, so this implementation uses <span class="code">AutoMapper</span> to map from the 
    custom section class to the middleware configuration class. Your application must configure
    <span class="code">AutoMapper</span>to perform this mapping.
</p>
<p>
    If all of this sounds like too much trouble then consider using another more flexible 
    configuration mechanism (such as Urchin).

<div class="app_warning">
    The Microsoft <span class="code">ConfigurationManager</span> does not support dynamic
    reconfiguration, so if you use this configuration mechanism you will have to restart
    your website for configuration changes to be effective.
