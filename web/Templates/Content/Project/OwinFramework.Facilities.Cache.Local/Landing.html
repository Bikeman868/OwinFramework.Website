<p>
    This package provides an implementation of the <span class="code">ICache</span> interface.
    To make this implementation available to other packages that need this interface you just need to add
    the NuGet package to the project - that's it, there is nothing else to do.
</p>

<div class="app_warning">
    This implementation is great for demos, hello world, and other experimental
    projects but is not useful for production applications.
</div>

<p>
    This package stores cached data within the process. It does not allow sharing of
    data accross multiple servers - which is the whole point, and this is why this package
    is not recommended for production applications.
</p>

<p>
    This package has no configuration options.
