<title>The OwinFramework.Authorization Project</title>
<p>
    The <a href="/content/repository/OwinFramework.Authorization/readme">authorization repository readme</a>
    file contains documentation on the key concepts around authorization in the Owin Framework. It is strongly
    recommended that you read it before using this assembly.

<div class="app_warning">
    This package checks that the identity making the request has the required permissions. You must add
    middleware to the pipeline that implements <span class="code">IMiddleware&lt;IIdentification></span>
    for this to work.
</div>

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Authorization.AuthorizationMiddleware>())
    .As("Authorization")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/authorization");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "authorization": {
            "documentationRootUrl": "/owin/authorization/config"
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<div class="app_hint">
    There are not many configuration options on this package beacuse all that it does
    is enforce permissions provided by other middleware downstream using an implementation
    of <span class="code">IIdentityData</span> injected by IoC.
