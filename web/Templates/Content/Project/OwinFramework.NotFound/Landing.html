<title>The OwinFramework.NotFound Project</title>
<p>
    This middleware will return a 404 response always. It will place itself after all other
    middleware in the pipeline so that when no other middleware handled the request a 404
    response will be returned to the client.
</p>
<p>
    If you want this behaviour only on certain routes through the OWIN pipeline then you can configure
    this middleware only on those routes. You can also add multiple instances of this middleware to
    the OWIN pipeline to have different 404 templates for different routes. For example if you have
    an API that returns JSON, you might want the API to also return JSON in the 404 case.

    For this to work efficiently you should configure output caching. Without output caching
    the .less file will be compiled on every request.

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.NotFound.NotFoundMiddleware>())
    .As("Not found")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/notfound");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "notfound": {
            "documentationRootUrl": "/owin/notFound/config",
            "template": ""
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<h2>Configuration notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        You can set the <span class="code">documentationRootUrl</span> to null or
        empty to disable this documentation in your production environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <span class="code">template</span> setting should be the path to an
        html file that is to be sent as the response. If you do not provide a
        template then the template embedded into the Not Found middleware assembly
        will be used. The setting you configure is passed to the
        <span class="code">MapPath()</span> method so you can include
        <span class="code">~</span> meaning the root folder of the website.
    </li>
</ul>
