<p>
    This middleware provides session for your website or webservice using
    the <span class="code">ICache</span> interface implementation registered 
    with IoC.
</p>

<p>
    Session is a dictionary of name/value pairs that is unique to each visitor
    to the website. The user is identified by storing a cookie on thier browser.
</p>
<p>
    You typically want to provide an <span class="code">ICache</span> implementation
    that provides a consistent view across servers so that you do not need sticky
    sessions, but you can also use an in-memory cache and sticky sessions if you want.

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Session.CacheSessionMiddleware>())
    .As("Session")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/session");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "session": {
            "cacheCategory": "session",
            "sessionDuration": "00:20:00",
            "cookieName": "owin-framework-sid",
            "cookieDomainName": ""
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<h2>Configuration notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The cache category is passed to the <span class="code">ICache</span> interface
        so that it can implement business logic that is specific to session storage.
    </li>
    <li>
        You should set the cookie domain name to your root domain if you want to
        share session across multiple services that are in sub-domains. For example
        if you have services at <span class="code">https://service1.mycompany.com/</span> 
        and <span class="code">https://service2.mycompany.com/</span>
        then you should set the <span class="code">cookieDomainName</span> to 
        <span class="code">mycompany.com</span>
    </li>
</ul>
