<p>
    This middleware serves static files. This middleware works with any output cache
    middleware that you have installed to ensure that files are cached both on the
    server and also by the browser.
</p>
<p>
    Static files are files shipped with your website that contain content that can 
    be directly consumed by the browser. These are usually HTML, CSS, Javascript and
    image files, but can be any file that the browser can accept and process.
</p>

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.StaticFiles.StaticFilesMiddleware>())
    .As("Static files")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/staticFiles");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.

<h2>Configuration Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        You can restrict access to the static files by configuring 
        the <span class="code">requiredPermission</span>. For this to 
        work you must add Authorization middleware to the Owin Pipeline.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <span class="code">rootDirectory</span> can be an absolute file
        path, UNC file path, relative to the current working directory, or
        start with <span class="code">~</span> to use the <span class="code">MapPath</span>
        method of <span class="code">IHostingEnvironment</span>.This
        middleware will serve files in sub-directories of this root by default.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <span class="code">staticFilesRootUrl</span> is the URL within your
        website where the static files will be available for download.
    </li>
    <li>
        With the Owin Framework the same middleware can be added to the Owin
        Pipeline multiple times with each instance having a different 
        configuration. This is especially useful if you want to serve static
        files from different locations, or with different permissions.
    </li>
</ul>
