<p>
    This middleware will handle requests for .css files. If there is a physical file with a
    .css extension then it will serve this file. If there is no .css file on disk but there
    is a .less file with the same name, then it will use dotless to compile the less file
    into css and send this as the response.
</p>

<div class="app_warning">
    For this to work efficiently you should configure output caching. Without output caching 
    the .less file will be compiled on every request.
</div>

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Less.LessMiddleware>())
    .As("Less")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/less");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "less": {
            "documentationRootUrl": "/owin/less/config",
            "rootUrl": "/styles",
            "rootDirectory": "~\\styles",
            "enabled": true,
            "analyticsEnabled": true,
            "minify": false,
            "traceLog": false
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<h2>Configuration notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        You can set the <span class="code">documentationRootUrl</span> to null or
        empty to disable this documentation in your production environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        In your production environment you probably want to turn off analytics and
        turn on minification.
    </li>
    <li>
        If your .less file is invalid then a blank css response will not be served. In this
        situation you can turn on the trace logging and also turn on tracing in the
        Owin Framework to see the error that is preventing your .less code from compiling.
    </li>
</ul>
