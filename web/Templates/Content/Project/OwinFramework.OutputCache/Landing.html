<p>
    This middleware will improve the performance of your web site by
    capturing the output from downstream middleware and saving it in
    the <span class="code">ICache</span> facility, then using the cached 
    response when another identical request is received.
</p>
<p>
    The output is only cached when dwnstream middleware indicates that it is valid
    to cache the response. Other Middleware (like the static file middleware)
    will communicate with the output cache when installed to tell it when the
    response can be cached.
</p>
<p>
    Downstream middleware can set a category and a priority in the output cache for
    each request. The output cache can be configured with different cache behavours 
    for all combinations of these two values.

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.OutputCache.OutputCacheMiddleware>())
    .As("Output cache")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/outputCache");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "outputCache": {
            "documentationRootUrl": "/outputCache",
            "rules": null
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<div class="app_warning">
    Note that this default configuration means that nothing will be cached. In order to
    have some output cached you need to add some rules.
</div>

<h2>Cache rules</h2>
<p>
    The output cache middleware must have rules defined before it will cache anything. The
    rules define what kind of caching to apply to each type of content that can be requested
    from your website.
</p>
<p>
    When downstream middleware indicates that caching is possible on the content that
    it is producing, it passes back a "Category" and "Priority" to the output cache. In
    the output cache rules you can match on one, both or neither of these and define the
    caching behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Below is an example configuration that provides some caching:
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "outputCache": {
            "documentationRootUrl": "/outputCache",
            "rules": [
                {
                    "category": "UserProfile",
                    "priority": "High",
                    "cacheCategory": "Shared",
                    "serverCacheTime": "00:30:00",
                    "browserCacheTime": "00:10:00"
                },
                {
                    "category": "Product",
                    "priority": "Always",
                    "cacheCategory": "Local",
                    "serverCacheTime": "01:00:00",
                    "browserCacheTime": "00:30:00"
                },
                {
                    "category": "Product",
                    "priority": "Medium",
                    "cacheCategory": "Local",
                    "serverCacheTime": "00:10:00",
                    "browserCacheTime": "2"
                }
            ]
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<div class="app_hint">
    Note that the <span class="code">category</span> and <span class="code">priority</span> are used
    to figure out which rule to apply, then the <span class="code">cacheCategory</span> is passed to
    the <span class="code">ICache</span> implementation.
</div>
<div class="app_hint">
    Note that the <span class="code">serverCacheTime</span> can be zero to disable server side caching,
    and <span class="code">browserCacheTime</span> can be set to zero to disable caching in the browser.
</div>
<div class="app_warning">
    If you are configuring the <span class="code">browserCacheTime</span> to a large value you should
    include some kind of cache buster in your URL or you will have no way to force the browser to
    retrieve a new version of the content after a production deployment.
</div>
