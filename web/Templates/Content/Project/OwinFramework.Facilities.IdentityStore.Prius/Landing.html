<title>The OwinFramework.Facilities.IdentityStore.Prius Project</title>
<p>
    The <a href="/content/repository/OwinFramework.Authorization/readme">authorization repository readme</a>
    file contains documentation on the key concepts around authorization in the Owin Framework. It is strongly
    recommended that you read it before using this assembly.

    This package provides an implementation of the following interfaces:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="code">IIdentityStore</span> provides a persistence mechanism for agents that
        can identify themselves to the system. This includes username/password combinations, shared
        secrets, certificates and OAuth tokens.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="code">IIdentityDirectory</span> provides a way for administrators to search for an
        identity so that they can assign permissions. For example you might want to search your Active
        Directory for users. In the case of this implementation it searches the SQL database that was
        populated by calls to the <span class="code">IIdentityStore</span> interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="code">IPasswordHasher</span> provides a versioned password hashing algorithm. When
        users update their password it will be hashed with the latest version. When users login the
        version of the hashing algorithm that was used to store their password will be used to validate
        their password.
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="app_hint">
    To make these implementations available to other packages that need these interfaces you just need to add
    the NuGet package to the project - that's it, there is nothing else to do.
</div>

<div class="app_hint">
    You can override these interface implementations individually within your application by adding
    your application assembly to Ioc Modules explicitly after probing the bin folder. For example you
    might want to just override the password hasher but use the other implementations from this assembly.
</div>

<div class="app_warning">
    This package persists identity data using the Prius ORM. You will need to create a database
    and configure Prius within your application for this to work. The source code for this project
    includes an SqlScripts folder containing the SQL scrips you need to create the database.
</div>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this package.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "facility": {
         "identityStore.Prius": {
            "priusRepositoryName": "IdentityStore",
            "identityUrnNamespace": "identity",
            "mixedCaseTokens": false,
            "mixedCaseIdentity": false,
            "mixedCaseSharedSecret": true,
            "minimumUserNameLength": 3,
            "maximumUserNameLength": 80,

<h2>Configuration notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mixed case identifiers are slightly shorter but you must ensure that the casing is preserved
        throughout the rest of your code. All lower case identifiers are only slightly longer.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <span class="code">identityUrnNamespace</span> will be used to construct URNs that uniquely
        identifiy identities. The default value of "identity" means that URNs will be similar to
        "urn:identity:abc123".
    </li>
</ul>
