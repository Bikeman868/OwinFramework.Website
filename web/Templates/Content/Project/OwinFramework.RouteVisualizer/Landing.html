    This middleware will produce an SVG drawing of the Owin Pipeline. The drawing
    shows all of the routes and middleware that runs on each route. If middleware
    exposes analytics then these are also shown on the drawing.
</p>

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.RouteVisualizer.RouteVisualizerMiddleware>())
    .As("Route visualizer")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/routeVisualizer");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "routeVisualizer": {
            "documentationRootUrl": "/owin/visualization/docs/configuration",
            "path": "/owin/visualization",
            "enabled": true,

<h2>Configuration notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        You can set the <span class="code">documentationRootUrl</span> to null or
        empty to disable this documentation in your production environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        In your production environment you probably want to turn off the route visualizer
        or place it on a route where authorization is required.
    </li>
</ul>
