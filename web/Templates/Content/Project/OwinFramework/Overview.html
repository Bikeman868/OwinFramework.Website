<p>The Owin Framework is an open architecture that defines a framework.
   Developers can build their Owin pipeline components on this framework
   so that they can easily be shared and reused by others.</p>

<p>This project defines the Owin Framewprk in terms of interfaces that
    facilitate this sharing of Owin pipeline components. These interfaces
    are designed to promote interoperabiliy of components without placing
    constraints on how those components function. This is true to the original
    concept behind OWIN.</p>
