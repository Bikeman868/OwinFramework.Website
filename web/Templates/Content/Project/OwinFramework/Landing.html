<title>The OwinFramework Project</title>
<p>
    The <span class="code">OwinFramework</span> project contains a few useful
    utility classes, but is mainly focused on the interfaces that define the
    framework, and an implementation of a middleware pipeline builder.
</p>
<p>
    All of the other projects provide implementations of the interfaces defined
    by the <span class="code">OwinFramework</span> project.
