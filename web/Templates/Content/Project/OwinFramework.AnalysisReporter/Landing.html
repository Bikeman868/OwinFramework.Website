<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.AnalysisReporter.AnalysisReporterMiddleware>())

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.

<pre>{

      "middleware": {
         "analysisReporter": {
               "path": "/owin/analytics",

               "defaultFormat ": "application/json"

      }
   }
}</pre>

<div class="app_hint">
    The default format applies when there is no <span class="code">Accept</span>
    header in the request.

<div class="app_hint">
    In your production environment you should either disable this middleware
    or configure the <span class="code">requiredPermission</span> and include
