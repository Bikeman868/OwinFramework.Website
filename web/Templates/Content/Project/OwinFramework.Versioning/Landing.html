<p>
    This middleware will improve the performance of your web site by adding 
    a version number to the URLs of static assets and instructing the browser 
    to cache them indefinately.
</p>
<p>
    Each time you release a new version of your web site you should increment
    the version number so that the browser sees them as new assets and fetches 
    them from the server. Once the server has a particular version of an asset 
    it will keep hold of it any not request it again, this improves the user 
    experience and reduces load on your servers.
</p>
<p>
    This middleware performs these actions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It will intercept HTML, CSS and JS output on its way out to the browser, replacing 
        a special marker with the current version number. This marker must be placed immediately 
        before the file extension. For example <span class="code">&lt;img src="button{_v_}.png" /></span>
        will be replaced with <span class="code">&lt;img src="button_v3.png" /></span> if the 
        current version number is 3. This HTML, CSS and JS can be produced by any downstream middleware
        including Static Files and Pages.
    </li>
    <li>
        It will intercept incomming requests for assets (based on file extension) and strip off the 
        version number before forwarding the request to the downstream middleware. This makes the
        versioning operation transparent to the middleware downstream.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Versioning.VersioningMiddleware>())
    .As("Versioning")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/staticFiles");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "session": {
            "documentationRootUrl": "/versioning",
            "version": 1,
            "mimeTypes": [ "text/html", "text/css", "application/javascript" ],
            "fileExtensions": [],
            "browserCacheTime": "365d",
            "exactVersion": false,
            "analyticsEnabled": true
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<h2>Configuration Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you set the <span class="code">exactVersion</span> to 
        <span class="code">true</span> then requests for assets with
        the wrong version number will result in a 404 (not found) response
        to the browser. The default is to return the current content nomatter
        which version is requested.
    </li>
    <li>
        You need to configure <span class="code">fileExtensions</span> to the
        set of file extensions that you want this middleware to handle or it will
        not work.
    </li>
</ul>
