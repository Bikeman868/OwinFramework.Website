<p>
    This middleware adds the following behaviour to your website:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Wraps the downstream OWIN pipeline in a try/catch block.</li>
    <li>
        When exceptions are caught, if they are of type HttpException then
        the Http status code and message from the exception are send back to 
        the client as a valid http response.
    </li>
    <li>
        For other kinds of execptions the middleware returns either a public 
        apology page or detailed technical information. The public apology 
        page is templated and the default template allows a message to be
        inserted. For many applications you will want to change the template 
        to match the design of the rest of your site.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optionally sends email with detailed technical information about
        the exception that occured.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.ExceptionReporter.ExceptionReporterMiddleware>())
    .As("Exception reporter")
    .ConfigureWith(config, "/owinFramework/middleware/exceptions");
</pre>

<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the 
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this middleware.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "middleware": {
         "exceptions": {
            "message": null,
            "template": null,
            "requiredPermission": null,
            "localHost": true,
            "emailAddress": null,
            "emailSubject": "Unhandled exception in web site"
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<h2>Configuration Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        To send emails when unhandled exceptions are caught, configure a valid
        email address and configure the standard .Net email sender with SMTP details.
    </li>
    <li>
        When "localHost" is set to "true", requests originating from the web server
        machine always result in detailed technical information.
    </li>
    <li>
        To return detailed technical information only to centain users, install
        Identification and Authorization middleware then configure the "requiredPermission"
        to the code name of a permission that you configured in authorization.
    </li>
    <li>
        To define the public apology message set the "message" property to a string.
    </li>
    <li>
        To completely replace the public message with a page of your own design set the
        "template" property to the path of your template file.
    </li>
</ul>
