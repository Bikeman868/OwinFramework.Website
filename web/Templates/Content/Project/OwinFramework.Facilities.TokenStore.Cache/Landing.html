<p>
    This package provides an implementation of the <span class="code">ITokenStore</span> interface
    using whatever implementation of <span class="code">ICache</span> is configured in your application.
</p>

<div class="app_hint">
    To make this implementation available to other packages that need this interface you just need to add
    the NuGet package to the project - that's it, there is nothing else to do.

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The configuration below is the configuration you will get by default if you do not provide
    a configuration for this package.
</p>
<pre>{
   "owinFramework": {
      "facility": {
         "tokenStore.Cache": {
            "lifetime": "01:00:00",
            "cachePrefix": "/tokens/"
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

<div class="app_hint">
    The "cachePrefix" value is passed to the <span class="code">ICache</span> interface where it
    can be used to configure the caching behaviour.
</div>

<h2>Token rules</h2>
<p>
    This package implements the following token rules:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only tokens that have been created are valid. Checking a random token string will always result in a 'not valid' response.</li>
    <li>Tokens are no longer valid after they have expired.</li>
    <li>Tokens are only valid for the purpose, identity and token type they were created with.</li>
    <li>If a token is created with no purpose then it is valid for any purpose.</li>
    <li>If a token is created with no identity than it is valid for all identities.</li>
    <li>It is not valid to create a token with no token type.</li>
    <li>All token types are treated identically.</li>
    <li>The token itself is case sensitive.</li>
    <li>The token type, purpose and identity are case insentitive.</li>
    <li>When tokens are deleted they are deleted from the cache and immediately become invalid.</li>
</ul>
