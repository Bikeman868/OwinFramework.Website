<p>
    This middleware provides a debug view of web pages produced by the Pages middleware.
</p>
<p>
    To use this middleware add it to the OWIN pipeline then run your code and
    request pages from your website but include <span class="code">debug=true</span>
    in the query string of the page.
</p>
<p>
    When you do this, instead of rendering the page itself, the Debug Middleware will
    intercept the request and render a page showing how that page would be rendered,
    including how the data binding context will be established etc.
</p>

<h2>Adding this middleware to the Owin pipeline</h2>
<pre>
 builder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Pages.DebugMiddleware.DebugInfoMiddleware>())
    .As("Pages debug");    
</pre>
<div class="app_warning">
    The assumes that you are using Ninject as your IoC container, and followed the
    <a href="/content/general/walkthrough/helloworld">getting started walkthrough</a>. If this is not the case
    then you will need to adjust the code to work in your application.
</div>

<h2>Displaying Debug Information</h2>
<p>
    You can view debug information for any page that is produced by the Pages middleware
    by adding a query string parameter to the page URL. Below are some examples:
</p>
<pre>
    http://mywebsite.com/folder/page1?debug=true
    http://mywebsite.com/folder/page1?debug=xml
    http://mywebsite.com/folder/page1?debug=json
    http://mywebsite.com/folder/page1?debug=html
    http://mywebsite.com/folder/page1?debug=svg
</pre>

<h2>Enhancing Debug Information</h2>
<p>
    If you write custom regions, layouts, components etc, you can include more
    detailed information in the debug output by overriding a protected method
    of the base class called <span class="code">PopulateDebugInfo&lt;T></span>.
