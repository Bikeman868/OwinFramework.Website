<ul>
	<li>

		This tag can have attributes defined including the css class name.
	</li>
	<li>
		They can render custom css and Javascript into any page that includes one
		or more instance of the region.
	</li>
	<li>
		They can establish a data binding context that determines how requets for
		data are resolved for the descendents inside the region. For example if you
		have a component that renders an address and you put this component inside
		a region, the region can determine whether the address data will be the
		delivery address or billing address.
