    This area of the Owin Framework contains equivalent functionallity to Microsoft
    ASP.Net + MVC, Microsoft Katana, or Microsoft Core. Unlike the Microsoft implementations,
    this was designed from the outset to be an open architecture that can be built
    to by many independent contributors.
</p>

<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>

<p>The Pages Middleware has the following architecture at the highest level:</p>

<p>
    At the core is a Fluent Builder. This class implements interfaces for building
    various elements by delegating to plug-in builders. The Pages middleware project
    contains a complate set of builders already, but other developers can publish
    alternate implementations and application developers can also register custom
    builders with the fluent builder.
</p>

<p>
    The Fluent Builder provides a fluent syntax for defining pages, layouts, regions
    etc that define your entire website and webservice endpoints but it is too
    long winded and detailed for many situations so there is another layer on top
    of it to make common tasks more straightforward.
</p>

<p>
    Packages use the Fluent Builder directly to define reusable packages. For example
    the Owin Framework Pages Middleware comes with a number of packages. These packages
    contain layouts, regions, components and services that can be added to your website
    in a single line of code. An example of one of these packages is the menu package
    which can render a responsive drop-down menu which becomes a slide-out hamburger
    menu at small sizes. You can see this package in operation on this website.
</p>

<p>
    Template parsers parse text files that are deployed with the website and contain
    templated content. There are a few parsers built into these packages, other
    developers can also publish parsers that support different syntaxes and data
    binding and repeating schemes. Template parsers use the Fluent Builder to
    construct various elements from the templates that they parse.
</p>

<p>
    Template loaders retrieve templates and push them through a specific parser.
    The template loaders then watch for changes and update the elements by parsing
    the changed templates. There are template loaders for the local file system
    and for downloading from a URL. It would also be quite easy to write an
    application specific one that reads templates from an application database.
</p>

<p>
    The CMS portion is a combination of a specific database schema, a template
    loader that understands this schema, a UI for creating and managing webpage
    elements in the browser, and a back-end service to support the UI. This provides
    a way for non-developers to make simple changes to pages on the website. Note
    that this is not a comprehensive Content Management System, more of a page
    layout editor.
