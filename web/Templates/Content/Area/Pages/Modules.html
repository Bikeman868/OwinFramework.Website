<h2>Module Elements</h2>

<p>
    Module elements define how JavaScript and css assets are deployed on the
	website you are building. You can choose which module to associate with
	each region, page, component etc and the assets produced by that element
	will be deployed according to that module's definition.
</p>
<p>
	For example you might have some cross-cutting assets that are used on virtually
	every page on your website and should be deployed site wide whereas other elements
	might be specific to a small number of pages and can be collected up into one
	JavaScript asset and deployed only to pages that need them. To do this you would
	define two modules and and choose the appropriate module for each element of
	your website.

    <p>
        Note that elements inherit the module from their parent element by defaultso 
		you only need to override this at strategic points. The only exception to this
		are pages (which have no parent element) and default to deploying assets
		site wide without using modules.
