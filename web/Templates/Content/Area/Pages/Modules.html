<title>Modules Overview | The Owin Framework Pages</title>
<h2>Module Elements</h2>

<p>
	Module elements define how Javascript and css assets are deployed on the
	website you are building. You can choose which module to associate with
	each region, page, component etc and the assets produced by that element
	will be deployed according to that module's configuration.
</p>
<p>
	For example you might have some cross-cutting assets that are used on virtually
	every page on your website and should be deployed site wide whereas other elements
	might be specific to a small number of pages and can be collected up into one
	Javascript asset and deployed only to pages that need them. To do this you would
	define two modules and and choose the appropriate module for each element of
	your website.
</p>
<div class="app_hint">
	<p>
		Note that elements inherit the module from their parent element by default so
		you only need to override this at strategic points. The only exception to this
		are pages (which have no parent element) and default to deploying assets
		site wide without using modules.
	</p>
</div>
<p>
	Modules have an <span class="code">AssetDeployment</span> property that defines how the assets
	associated with this module are deployed. The general idea is that every page element
	(region, layout, component etc) is configured to be part of a module and that module's
	configuration determines how the Javascript and CSS for that page element will be
	incorporated into the website
</p>
<p>
	The possible values for the <span class="code">AssetDeployment</span> property are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span class="code">Inherit</span> means that page elements in this module interit
		the asset deployment mechanism of their containing page element. If all elements
		are set to <span class="code">Inherit</span> (which is the default) then they all
		follow the asset deployment mechanism set in the page. Pages default to
		<span class="code">PerWebsite</span>, so by default all Javascript and all CSS
		for the entire website will be combined into a single asset.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="code">InPage</span> means that page elements in this module write
		CSS and Javascript directly into the <span class="code">&lt;head></span> section
		of the page. This option is mainly useful for debugging and generating html for
		emails.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="code">PerPage</span> means that each page will have a Javascript and
		CSS asset that is specific to that page and contains everything that that page
		needs to render. If the same page element is used on multiple pages then its
		CSS and Javascript will be duplicated in all the page specific assets for the
		pages where it is referenced. This option means that the page will only reference
		exactly what it needs, but the broswer will have to fetch the assets associated
		with every page that the user visits.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="code">PerModule</span> means that there will be a Javascript and a
		CSS asset associated with the module. The Javascript and CSS for a particular
		page element will only appear in the module specific asset. Module assets will
		be referenced by any page that contains any of the page elements contained in
		that module. This option is useful for areas of the website that need a lot
		if CSS or Javascript but are not frequented by every visitor to the website, for
		example a shopping cart, or the administration tools for a content management system.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span class="code">PerWebsite</span> means that there is a single Javascript
		and CSS asset for the entire website. The page elements in this module will
		write their CSS and Javascript into these global assets which will be referenced
		by every page on the website. This means that the first page visited will incur
		the penalty of downloading all of the CSS and Javascript assets, but after that
		it is cached by the browser and no further assets are required to visit other
		pages.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Note that you can mix up the asset deployment properties as much as you want, even
	within a single page.
</p>

<h3>Modules and Packages</h3>

<p>
	Packages are a way of isolating a chunck of reusable functionallity that can include
	html, css, Javascript, services and back-end logic. Packages are typically added
	to a website to add some functionallity to that website.
</p>
<p>
	Modules are a way for the application developer to group elements together by
	the method used to deploy their assets. Becasue these are very different use
	cases, it does not make sense to build a package that contains modules, and
	this is not supported by the framework.
</p>

<h3>Writing custom modules</h3>

<p>
	Although in theory you could write a custom module that inherits from the built-in
	<span class="code">Module</span> class or implements the <span class="code">IModule</span>
	interface, there is very little point in doing so because the module provides no
	functionallity.
