<title>Page Elements Overview | The Owin Framework Pages</title>
<h2>Elements</h2>

<p>
    In the Pages Framework you build your web application by defining
    elements. These elements are of specific types that fit into the
    overall design of the Pages Framework. This page briefly describes
    each type of element and provides a link to a page that provides
    more detail.
</p>

<p>
    The Fluent Builder is the entry point for building elements, it is
    used by the template parsers, CMS and other high level pieces that
    help to define your web application.
</p>
<p>
    The fluent builder has a plug-in architecture allowing specific build
    engines to be selected for each type of element. This documentation
    describes the build engines that come with the Pages Framework itself.
    If you configure a third party build engine for a specifc element type,
    then you should refer to the third party documentation instead.
</p>
<p>
    You can also write a build engine as part of your application if you
    want to change how elements are built, but still want to use the
    template languages or CMS features of the Pages Framework.
</p>

<h3><a href="pages">Page Elements</a></h3>
<p>
    These elements are the html pages of your website. Each page element
    can be dynamic and parameterized resulting in what appears to be many
    pages to a visitor to your website. If you look at the source code for
    this website you will see it contains very few Page Elements even though
    this website contains many pages of content.
</p>
<p>
    Every Page Element must specify a <a href="layouts">Layout Element</a>
    that defines the arangement of content on the page. Several pages can
    share the same layout but populate the regions of the layout differently.
</p>

<h3><a href="layouts">Layout Elements</a></h3>
<p>
    These elements define a fixed arrangement of regions that can have
    content placed in them. Each region of the layout must be named so that
    the contents of each region can be defined for the various places where
    the layout is used.
</p>
<div class="app_hint">
    Note that the regions of a layout contain <a href="regions">Region Elements</a>
    but the name of	the regions within the layout do not have to match the name
    of the Region Element within it, and typically it is more readable if these
    names are different, for example:
    <pre>
    [IsLayout("two_column", "left,right")]
    [ZoneRegion("left", "fixed_left_region")]
    [ZoneRegion("right", "flexible_right_region")]
    [RegionHtml("left", null, "Left column content")]
    [RegionHtml("right", null, "Right column content")]
    internal class TwoColumnLayout { }
	</pre>
</div>
<p>
    The layout itself can also be named, and this name can be used to specify
    which layout to use (for example on a specific page). Elements with name
    references can be defined in any order - all of the name references are
    resolved after all of the elements are loaded.
</p>
<p>
    Each region of the layout can contain one <a href="regions">Region Element</a>
    that defines how this region of the layout behaves (alignment, wrapping, resizing etc).
    The CSS and Javascript of the layout and the regions within it define how the layout
    is rendered and how it interacts with content and with the user.
</p>

<h3><a href="regions">Region Elements</a></h3>
<p>
    These elements define the appearence and behavior of a rectangular
    area of your web pages. The same Region Element can be used in every
    place where the same visual appearence and interaction behaviour is needed.
</p>
<p>
    Region Elements can be bound to a list of obejcts and will repeat the contents
    of the region for each object in the list. Region Elements can also define
    a data binding scope for everything inside the region.
</p>
<p>
    Each region can contain one of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>A <a href="layouts">Layout Element</a></li>
        <li>A <a href="components">Component Element</a></li>
        <li><a href="localization">Localized HTML</a> that you can customize for each geographic locale</li>
        <li>A <a href="templates">template</a> that was loaded by the template loading and parsing system</li>
    </ul>
</p>

</div>

<h3><a href="components">Component Elements</a></h3>
<p>
    These elements render the majority of the html on the page. You would typically
    write these as classes that inherit from the <span class="code">Component</span>
    base class and override virtual methods to output html.
</p>
<div class="app_hint">
    Note that you do not have to use components, you can use one of the template parsing
    mechanisms instead. Template parsers construct components for you by parsing a
    template language. Many parsers support syntaxes for data binding and repeating.

<h3><a href="packages">Package Elements</a></h3>
<p>
    Packages define a namespace for browser assets, especially CSS classes and
    Javascript functions. You might want to break your own assets into namespaces
    if you have a very large and complex application, but this is not the reason
    why packages exist in this design.
</p>
<p>
    Packages solve the problem of how to publish reusable libraries of plug-in
    functionallity and have these all integrate without stepping on each other's
    toes. The packaging system allows third party contributors to build a package
    that includes layouts, regions, components etc where these things have custom
    CSS and Javascript associated with them.
</p>
<p>
    Each package has a default namespace that is prepended to CSS class names and
    is used to encapsulate Javascript functions. The application developer can
    override the namespace when integrating the package into their solution
    to ensure that package namespaces do not clash.
</p>
<p>
    As well as creating a Package Element, you can also attach the
    <span class="code">[PartOf]</span> attribute to add them to a package namespace.
</p>
<p>
    It is recommended that you create an "app" package for your application but
    this is not required.

<h3><a href="modules">Module Elements</a></h3>
<p>
    Modules are a way of grouping browser assets that have the same deployment
    rules. Essentially the Pages Framework dynamically constructs one CSS and
    one Javascript resource for each page, for each module, and for the website
    as a whole. These are generated in memory and served to the browser by the
    <span class="code">AssetManager</span> class. The HTML pages produced by
    the framework contain references to any of these assets that are required
    for the page to work.
</p>
<p>
    When you create Elements such as Regions, Components and Pages, you can add
    a <span class="code">[DeployedAs]</span> attribute to the class to specify
    how the assets for this element should be deployed. The default is to inherit
    from the parent element.

<h3><a href="services">Service Elements</a></h3>
<p>
    Service elements have Http requests routed directly to them and are responsible
    for constructing the whole response. Services can also produce responses that
    are not Html, in fact the default format is JSON.
</p>
<p>
    You should use services to handle AJAX calls and form POSTs from your website.
    You can also use service elements to provide APIs, especially in the case where
    you are writing a microservice.
</p>
<div class="app_hint">
    This is very different from most other element types which are built into a
    tree structure of layouts inside regions inside layouts etc. with a page
    at the top. In the case of pages. the page renders all of the elements in
    the tree to produce the response.

<h3><a href="dataproviders">Data Provider Elements</a></h3>
<p>
    The data provisioning model is very complex internally to make it as easy
    as possible for the developer. The design goals are based on these principals:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We want to modularize for reuse. This means that if I produce something
        that renders the presentation of an address I want to use the same code
        nomatter what kind of address it is or where it came from.
    </li>
    <li>
        We want to have good separation of concerns, ie the presentation layer
        to know nothing about where the data came from and the data layer to
        know nothing about how the data is presented.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pages need to be able to contain the same type of data multiple times
        from different sources. For example if I have presentation for a user
        profile, I might have a page that shows another user's profile and my
        own profile on the same page, and therefore these two instances of the
        same presentation need to connect with different instances of the
        profile data. In this framework this is referred to as "scope", and
        data scoping is handled by <a href="regions">Region Elements</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The same data can appear in multiple places on a page, but we don't
        want to fetch it multiple times because this is inefficient.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are many situations where a sub-tree of presentation elements
        need to be rendered once for each object in a list of objects in the
        body of the Html but rendred once only in other parts of the page.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    These goals are realized by the following design:
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <a href="dataproviders">Data Provider Elements</a> know how to retrieve
        specific kinds of data (optionally in specific scopes).
    </li>
    <li>
        Any element can have one or more <span class="code">[NeedsData]</span> attributes
        attached that specifies what data it needs. This includes the Data Provider elements.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="regions">Region Elements</a> can introduce a new scope for
        the sub-tree beneath the region.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="regions">Region Elements</a> can repeat their contents for each
        object in a list of objects.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pages perform a one-time resolution of data needs, scopes and data providers.
        This produces a list of the data sources that need to be run for the page. For
        each page request the data sources are executed in the context of the request
        before any rendering takes place. This ensures that data is only retrieved once.
    </li>
</ul>
