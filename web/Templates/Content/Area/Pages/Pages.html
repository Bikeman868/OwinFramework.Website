<h2>Page Elements</h2>

<p>
    Most websites will not need to create their own page elements because
    the built-in <span class="code">Page</span> class should provide everything
    you need for most situations. If you do want to do something unusual with
    a page or set of pages on your class then you can either inherit from the
    built-in <span class="code">Page</span> class or implement the 
    <span class="code">IPage</span> interface to fully customize how pages are
    rendered.

        This is an advanced topic not recommended for most application developers,
        and any code you write using custom page elements is not guaranteed to work in
        future versions of this framework.
