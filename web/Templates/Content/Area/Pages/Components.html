<h2>Component Elements</h2>

<p>
    Component elements are the leaves of the tree structure that defines
	an HTML page. The components are responsible for writing the HTML
	to the response that is sent back to the browser. The HTML to write
	is defined in C# code.
</p>
<div class="app_hint">
    <p>
        Note that you do not have to create C# classes for every piece of content,
	    that would be extremely time consuming and hard to manage. There are higher
	    level facilities that create components for you, for example the template
	    loader and template parser mechanism and the CMS packages.
	</p>
	<p>
	    You will typically only write component classes to gain access to low level control
		over the HTML that is produced, for example to write custom headers into the
	    <span class="code">&lt;head>&lt;/head></span> section of the page.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also write components to simplify your chosen scheme for editing and presenting
		content. For example this website that documents the Owin Framework has a component
		that maps the page URL onto a template path allowing me to define one page that
		renders hundreds of different templates creating all of the pages on the website.
	</p>
</div>
<p>
    Components have the following features:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">HtmlWriters</span>
		property and they will be called during the rendering of the page body. This is
		how things like template parsers configure components to render the template.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">CssRules</span>
		property and they will be called during the rendering of the CSS. The CSS can
		be rendered into the page head, or into a separate CSS file depending on the 
		asset deployment mechanism selected.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can set an array of lambda functions into the <span class="code">JavascriptFunctions</span>
		property and they will be called during the rendering of the JavaScript. The JavaScript can
		be rendered into the page head, or into a separate JavaScript file depending on the 
		asset deployment mechanism selected.
	</li>
    <li>
	    You can override the <span class="code">GetPageAreas</span> method to indicate
		which areas of the page your component will write to. To improve page rendering
		efficiency the rendering engine will prune areas of the tree that contain no
		components that render to a specific portion of the page when that part of the
		page is being rendered.
	</li>
    <li>
	    You can override the <span class="code">GetCommentName</span> method to provide a
		custom comment. These comments are written to the HTML when comments are turned on
		for debugging purposes.
	</li>
    <li>
	    You can override the <span class="code">WritePageArea</span> method to output custom
		HTML in any area of the page where this component exists. Note that this is only
		guaranteed to be called for page areas returned by the <span class="code">GetPageAreas</span> method.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing Custom HTML</h3>

<p>
	To write custom HTML to anywhere on the page override the <span class="code">WritePageArea</span>
	and <span class="code">GetPageAreas</span> methods. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    [IsComponent("person")]
    [NeedsData(typeof(Person))]
    internal class PersonComponent : Component
    {
        public PersonComponent(IComponentDependenciesFactory dependencies)
            : base(dependencies)
        {
        }

        public override IEnumerable&lt;PageArea> GetPageAreas()
        {
            return new[] { PageArea.Body };
        }

        public override IWriteResult WritePageArea(IRenderContext context, PageArea pageArea)
        {
            if (pageArea == PageArea.Body)
            {
                var person = context.Data.Get&lt;Person>();
                context.Html.WriteElementLine("p", person.Name);
            }
            return WriteResult.Continue();
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
	The <span class="code">WritePageArea</span> method is called once for each component
	instance on the page when rendering the body of the page, but when there are multiple
	components of the same type on a page, or the component is inside a repeating region
	the <span class="code">WritePageArea</span> method is called only once when writing
	other parts of the page. For example if your component writes to the 
	<span class="code">&lt;head>&lt;/head></span> section of the page and the component is 
	included multiple times on a page, then the <span class="code">WritePageArea</span> method
	will only be called once for each page with the <span class="code">pageArea</span>
	parameter set to <span class="code">PageArea.Head</span>.
</p>

<p>
	The <span class="code">WritePageArea</span> method must return an instance of the
	<span class="code">IWriteResult</span> interface. You can implement this interface
	yourself, or you can use static methods of the <span class="code">WriteResult</span>
	class. The purpose of the <span class="code">IWriteResult</span> is to let the rendering
	engine know if or when you are finished writing your HTML. The static methods of 
	<span class="code">WriteResult</span> work like this:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
		<span class="code">WriteResult.Continue()</span> means I have finished writing all of my Html
		but other components should be run to contribute output as well. This is the most frequently
		used use case.
	</li>
    <li>
		<span class="code">WriteResult.ResponseComplete()</span> means I have finished writing all of my Html
		and the response is now complete so do not render output from any other controls. This is
		mostly usefull when wtiring to the page title and you do not want to concatenate the results
		of all component that write to the page title.
	</li>
    <li>
		<span class="code">WriteResult.ContinueAsync(action)</span> means that my Html takes a long
		time to produce, so kick it off in a background thread and continue running other components.
		If other components also return <span class="code">WriteResult.ContinueAsync(action)</span> then
		these operations will continue in parallel on different threads. This option requires some special
		programmming to ensure that the asyncrhronously produced Html ends up in the correct sequence
		in the response. See section on this below.
	</li>
    <li>
		<span class="code">WriteResult.WaitFor(task)</span> means that I started a background task to
		write my Html. Please wait for this task to complete before sending the response back to the browser. 
		In the meantime the other components on the page will continue processing and outputting their Html.
		See section below on asyncrhronously writing to the Html output stream.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Consuming Data in your Component</h3>
<p>
	If your component needs data from a data provider it is better NOT to inject the data provider
	directly or look in the data catalog for it. Instead you should decorate your class with the
	<span class="code">[NeedsData()]</span> attribute. If you do it this way there are several advantages:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you place multiple components on the page that need the same data the data provider will only be called once.</li>
	<li>If you place the component inside a repeater that repeats the data it needs then it will work as expected.</li>
	<li>If the dependant data is available with multiple scopes then the page designer can choose which scope to apply and your component will receive the correct version of the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Here is an example of a component that uses data. This example will render Html for an address
</p>
<pre>
    [IsComponent("address")]
    [NeedsData(typeof(Address))]
    internal class AddressComponent : Component
    {
        public AddressComponent(IComponentDependenciesFactory dependencies)
            : base(dependencies)
        {
        }

        public override IWriteResult WritePageArea(IRenderContext context, PageArea pageArea)
        {
            if (pageArea == PageArea.Body)
            {
                var address = context.Data.Get&lt;Address>();
                context.Html.WriteElementLine("p", address.Street);
                context.Html.WriteElementLine("p", address.City);
                context.Html.WriteElementLine("p", address.ZipCode);
            }
            return WriteResult.Continue();
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
	The <span class="code">[NeedsData()]</span> attribute causes the requested type of data to be
	added to the <span class="code">IRenderContext</span> where you can retrieve it by calling the
	<span class="code">Get&lt;T>()</span> method of its <span class="code">Data</span> property.
</p>

<h3>Asyncronous HTML Output</h3>
<P>
	The Pages Framework is designed to be extremely flexible and scaleable and therefore prvides
	a mecahnism to allow components to contribute asynchronously to the Html output. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
        public override IWriteResult WriteBodyArea(IRenderContext context)
        {
            var html = context.Html;

            // Save this location in the output buffer
            var begining = html.CreateInsertionPoint();

            // Write a paragraph of text
            html.WriteElementLine("p", "This is paragraph 2");

            // Write a paragraph of text in a background thread
            var task = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
                {
                    // Simulate a call to a service or database here
                    Thread.Sleep(10);

                    begining.WriteElementLine("p", "This is paragraph 1");
                });

            // Write a third paragraph of text
            html.WriteElementLine("p", "This is paragraph 3");

            return WriteResult.WaitFor(task);
        }
</pre>
<p>
    In this example the resulting web page will contain the three paragraphs in
    numeric order even though paragraph 1 was written after the other two.
</p>

<h3>Components as Services</h3>
<p>
    You can decorate your component's class with the <span class="code">[IsService]</span>
    attribute to allow it to handle AJAX calls and Postbacks from the browser. There
    are a few supported use cases as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Make your component class inherit from the <span class="code">Service</span>
        class then implement the <span class="code">IComponent</span> inferface.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make your component class inherit from the <span class="code">Component</span>
        class but also add a default public constructor that can be used to construct
        the class as a service.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make your component class inherit from the <span class="code">Component</span>
        class but and pass the optional factory method when registering with the
        fluent builder. The builder will use the factory to construct a second
        instance of your component to act as the service.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
    This technique is especially useful for modularizing your AJAX calls because you
    can write a component the will write JavaScript functions to call the service,
    and also implement the service endpoints within the same class keeping these
    things close together. In this case adding the component to a website adds both
    the JavaScrpipt to call the service and the service endpoints.
</div>
<div>
    Postbacks are a bit more tricky in that they have to re-render the page after
    handling the postback. Exactly how you do that depends a lot in the overall
    architecture of your solution.
</div>

<h3>Component Attributes</h3>

<p>
	You can do some things with components without writing any code, this example is adapted
	from the menu package that is shipped with the Pages Framework:
</p>
<pre>
        // Desktop menu behavior
        [DeployCss("ul.{ns}_dt_menu", "list-style-type: none; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap;", 1)]
        [DeployCss("li.{ns}_dt_option", "display: inline-block;", 2)]
        [DeployCss("li.{ns}_dt_option a, a.{ns}_dt_option", "display: inline-block; text-decoration: none;", 3)]
        [DeployCss("div.{ns}_dt_dropdown", "display: none; position: absolute; overflow: hidden; z-index: 1;", 4)]
        [DeployCss("div.{ns}_dt_dropdown a", "text-decoration: none; display: block; text-align: left", 5)]
        [DeployCss("li.{ns}_dt_option:hover div.{ns}_dt_dropdown", "display: block;", 6)]

        // Hamburger button behavior
        [DeployCss("input[type=checkbox].{ns}_mb_hamburger_button", "display: none;", 20)]
        [DeployCss("label.{ns}_mb_hamburger_button", "transition: all 0.3s; cursor: pointer; ", 21)]
        [DeployCss("div.{ns}_mb_hamburger_icon", "transition: all 0.3s; position: relative; float: left; width: 100%;", 22)]
        [DeployCss("input[type=checkbox].{ns}_mb_hamburger_button:checked + label > .{ns}_mb_hamburger_icon_1", "transition: all 0.3s; transform: rotate(135deg);", 23)]
        [DeployCss("input[type=checkbox].{ns}_mb_hamburger_button:checked + label > .{ns}_mb_hamburger_icon_2", "transition: all 0.3s; opacity: 0;", 23)]
        [DeployCss("input[type=checkbox].{ns}_mb_hamburger_button:checked + label > .{ns}_mb_hamburger_icon_3", "transition: all 0.3s; transform: rotate(-135deg);", 23)]

        // Slideout menu behavior
        [DeployCss("ul.{ns}_mb_slideout", "position: absolute;", 24)]
        [DeployCss("input[type=checkbox].{ns}_mb_hamburger_button:checked ~ ul.{ns}_mb_slideout", "transform: translateX(0);", 25)]
		[IsComponent("menu_styles")]
        public class MenuStyles
        { }
</pre>

<p>
	By decorating your component with the <span class="code">[IsComponent("component_name")]</span> attribute
	you do not have to manually register each component with the Fluent Builder, instead you can ask the
	Fluent Builder to register everything in your assembly and it will use reflection to find all of the
	components.
</p>

<p>
	The other attributes you can add are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/content/project/owinframework.pages.html/attributes/deploycss"><span class="code">[DeployCss]</span></a> css rules to include on any page that includes this component</li>
    <li><a href="/content/project/owinframework.pages.html/attributes/deployfunction"><span class="code">[DeployFunction]</span></a> a JavaScript function to include on any page that has this component on it</li>
    <li><a href="/content/project/owinframework.pages.html/attributes/deployscript"><span class="code">[DeployCss]</span></a> css rules to include on any page that includes this component</li>
    <li><a href="/content/project/owinframework.pages.html/attributes/deployedas"><span class="code">[DeployedAs]</span></a> specifies how JavaScript and CSS should be deployed for this component</li>
    <li><a href="/content/project/owinframework.pages.html/attributes/needscomponent"><span class="code">[NeedsComponent]</span></a> identifies a dependent component</li>
    <li><a href="/content/project/owinframework.pages.html/attributes/needsdata"><span class="code">[NeedsData]</span></a> identifies data that is required for this component</li>
    <li><a href="/content/project/owinframework.pages.html/attributes/partof"><span class="code">[PartOf]</span></a> defines the package (namespace) for CSS and JavaScript in this component</li>
    <li><a href="/content/project/owinframework.pages.html/attributes/renderhtml"><span class="code">[RenderHtml]</span></a> makes this component render localized HTML</li>
</ul>

<h3>Components in packages</h3>

<p>
	You can create a reusable plug-in package. These packages can contain functionallity that can be added to
	a website with a single line of code. This technique is most often used to build open-source packages that
	are designed to be added to many websites and fulfill some common need, but you can also manage your own
	application using packages if you choose.
<p>
<p>
	When you create a package, the package's <span class="code">Build</span> method is called at startup. This is
	where the package creates all of the pages, layouts, components etc that comprise the package contents. This
	<span class="code">Build</span> method is passed an instance of <span class="code">IFluentBuilder</span> that
	can be used to build all of the package contents. The fluent builder has a namespace context that avoids namespace
	clashes with other packages and/or application code.
</p>
<p>
	This is an example of using the fluent builder to build a component.
<p>
<pre>
    public class CmsEditorPackage: IPackage
    {
        public CmsEditorPackage()
        {
            Name = "cms_editor";
            NamespaceName = "cmseditor";
        }

        IPackage IPackage.Build(IFluentBuilder fluentBuilder)
        {
			// ... some code omitted here for brevity
			
            var assetsComponent = fluentBuilder.BuildUpComponent(null)
                .Name("assets")
                .DeployIn(module)
                .DeployFunction(null, "initVue", null, script.ToString(), true)
                .RenderInitialization("cms-editor-init", "<script>ns." + NamespaceName + ".initVue();</script>")
                .DeployLess(less.ToString())
				.Build();

            return this;
        }
	}
</pre>
<p>
	Note that the Owin Framework NuGet package installs the xml documentation file alongside the dlls
	so you can get intellisense for the methods available in the fluent syntax.
</p>
<p>
	Note that you can combine all of these techniques together, for example you can write a class that
	inherits from <span class="code">Component</span> but also overrides methods of the base class, and
	uses the fluent builder syntax. This is illustrated in the example below:
</p>
<pre>
    public class LibrariesPackage : Framework.Runtime.Package
    {
        public LibrariesPackage(IPackageDependenciesFactory dependencies)
            : base(dependencies)
        {
            Name = "libraries";
            NamespaceName = "libraries";
        }

		[DeployedAs(AssetDeployment.InPage)]
        private class LibraryComponent : Component
        {
            public string[] Urls { get; set; }

            public LibraryComponent(IComponentDependenciesFactory dependencies, params string[] urls)
                : base(dependencies)
            {
                PageAreas = new[] { PageArea.Head };
                Urls = urls;
            }

            public override IWriteResult WritePageArea(IRenderContext context, PageArea pageArea)
            {
                if (pageArea == PageArea.Head)
                {
                    foreach (var url in Urls)
                        context.Html.WriteElementLine("script", string.Empty, "src", url);
                }

                return WriteResult.Continue();
            }
        }

        public override IPackage Build(IFluentBuilder builder)
        {
            builder.BuildUpComponent(
                new LibraryComponent(
                    Dependencies.ComponentDependenciesFactory, 
                    "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"))
                .Name("jQuery1")
                .Build();

            return this;
        }
    }
</pre>
