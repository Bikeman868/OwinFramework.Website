<h2>Component Elements</h2>

<p>
    Component elements are the leaves of the tree structure that defines
    an HTML page. The components are responsible for writing the HTML
    to the response that is sent back to the browser. The HTML to write
    is defined in C# code.
</p>
<div class="app_hint">
    <p>
        Note that you do not have to create C# classes for every piece of content,
        that would be extremely time consuming and hard to manage. There are higher
        level facilities that create components for you, for example the template
        loader and template parser mechanism constructs and configures components
        for each template.
    </p>
</div>

    Components have the following features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Can write Html, Css and Javascript to any part of the pages where this component exists.
        The component might exist on a page because it was specifically added to that page, or
        it might exist because something else on the page depends on it.
    </li>
    <li>
        They can specify which areas of the page they writes to. To improve page rendering
        efficiency the rendering engine will prune areas of the tree that contain no
        components that render to a specific portion of the page when that part of the
        page is being rendered.
    </li>
    <li>
        They can publish Css and Javascript assets that will be bundled into the module that
        the component is deployed as. These assets will be in a namespace if the component
        is part of a package.
    </li>
</ul>
