    This walkthrough assumes that you have already completed the <a href="website">Website walkthrough</a>.
    If you have not completed it yet I suggest you at least read through these instructions before continuing
    with this walkthrough.

<p>
    The Pages framework is plumbed to support localization, but it does not contain an implementation of the
    part that provides localized text yet.
