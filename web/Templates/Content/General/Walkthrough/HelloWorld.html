<title>Hello World with the OWIN Framework</title>
<h1>Hello, world</h1>

<p>
    If you want to jump straight to the solution, the end result of this
    walkthrough is available on <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/OwinFramework.Pages/tree/master/Sample2">GitHub</a>
</p>

<h2>Starting a new Visual Studio solution</h2>

<p>
    The most educational way of doing this walkthrough is by starting from a completely
    empty project and add all of the code. You don't need to actually type the code, copy/paste
    will work just fine.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        In Visual Studio start a new project of type "ASP.NET Empty Web Application".
        This will create a project that contains very little.
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to the NuGet package manager or use <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/">Paket</a> to install these NuGet packages
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">Ioc.Modules.Ninject</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">Owin.Framework</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">Owin.Framework.Urchin</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">Owin.Framework.Pages.Core</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">Owin.Framework.Pages.Framework</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">Owin.Framework.Pages.Html</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<div class="app_warning">
    Note that you might have to pick a specific version of <span class="code">Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb</span>
    because each version targets only specific versions of .Net.
</div>

<div class="app_hint">
    To install NuGet packages for .Net 4.0 you can copy/paste the lines below into the NuGet Package Manager Console:
<pre>
install-package Owin.Framework
install-package Ioc.Modules.Ninject
install-package Owin.Framework.Urchin
install-package Owin.Framework.Pages.Framework -IncludePrerelease
install-package Owin.Framework.Pages.Html -IncludePrerelease
install-package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb -version 2.1.0
</pre>
</div>

<div class="app_hint">

</div>

<h2>Configure your project as an OWIN website hosted on IIS</h2>

<p>
    Note that this step would be required for any OWIN application and is not
    specific to getting started with the Owin Framework.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Modify the <span class="code">web.config</span> file to use the <span class="code">ExtensionlessUrlHandler</span>.
        You can use <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/OwinFramework.Pages/blob/master/Sample1/Web.config">this file</a>
        as an example of what this should look like.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the root of your project add a new <span class="code">Startup.cs</span> file and under
        the <span class="code">using</span> statements and above the namespace statement add
        <pre>[assembly: OwinStartup(typeof(Startup))]</pre>
        Resolve references and make sure it compiles.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the <span class="code">Startup</span> class add a method with ths signature
        <pre>public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
{
}</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the necessary <span class="code">using</span> statements so that the code compiles.
    </li>
</ol>

<div class="app_hint">
    Note that we are using IIS hosted for this walkthrough, but OWIN provides many other hosting options.
    Please consult the Microsoft documentation for further details.
</div>

<h2>Configure an IoC container</h2>

<p>
    For this walkthrough we are going to use <a href="http://www.ninject.org/">Ninject</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/Urchin">Urchin</a>, but you can use any IoC container
    and any configuration mechanism you choose. There is <a href="/content/documentation/configuration/urchin">documentation</a> you can read and copy
    code from, or you can copy from <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/OwinFramework.Pages/blob/master/Sample2/Startup.cs">the completed example</a>
</p>

<p>
    Read the documentation to figure out what code you need to add, or just copy the code
    below to get going quickly.
</p>

<pre>
var packageLocator = new PackageLocator()
   .ProbeBinFolderAssemblies()
   .Add(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
var ninject = new StandardKernel(new Ioc.Modules.Ninject.Module(packageLocator));
</pre>


<h2>Set up the Owin Framework middleware pipeline</h2>

<p>
    This is the first step in this walktrhough that is specific to the Owin Framework
</p>

<p>
    You can review the <a href="/content/documentation/configuration/overview">documentation on Owin Framework configuration</a>, or you can look
    at <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/OwinFramework.Pages/blob/master/Sample2/Startup.cs"><span class="code">Startup.cs</span></a>
    for a working example to copy from.
</p>

<p>
    An example of the type of code you will need to add to your <span class="code">Startup</span>
    class is shown below for reference. In a real application there are a number of ways that you
    can write this code. For this walkthrough you can copy/paste if you like.
</p>

<pre>
var config = ninject.Get&lt;IConfiguration>();

var pipelineBuilder = ninject.Get&lt;IBuilder>();
pipelineBuilder.Register(ninject.Get&lt;PagesMiddleware>()).ConfigureWith(config, "/pages");

app.UseBuilder(pipelineBuilder);
</pre>

<h2>Configure the Pages middleware</h2>

<p>
    In this section you will configure the Pages middleware to scan your compiled code
    and construct web pages from classes that are decorated with custom attributes.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        At the end of the <span class="code">Configuration</span> method in your <span class="code">Startup</span> class,
        resolve <span class="code">IFluentBuilder</span> from your IoC container, for example
        <pre>var fluentBuilder = ninject.Get&lt;IFluentBuilder>();</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Install the Html element build engine with code similar to this:
        <pre>ninject.Get&lt;OwinFramework.Pages.Html.BuildEngine>().Install(fluentBuilder);</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Get the fluent builder to scan your application assembly for classes that are
        decorated with attributes that makes them into definitions of pages, regions,
        layouts etc. The fluent builder will use the build engines that we configured earlier.
        The extra line of code you need to add for this is:
        <pre>fluentBuilder.Register(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, after registering all of the elements of your website with the fluent
        builder you need to bind the elements together because they can reference each other
        by name, and they can be registered in any order. You will need these two lines of
        code to do this:
<pre>var nameManager = ninject.Get&lt;INameManager>();
nameManager.Bind();</pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<div class="app_hint">
    Note that there are a number of Build Engines included in the base libraries, and you can
    also install third party Build Engines that provide alternate implementations. Build Engines
    are like factories that contruct and configure Pages, Layouts, Regions, Components, Templates etc.
</div>

<div class="app_hint">
    Note that the fluent builder can register other things besides assemblies. Try using the
    Visual Studio intellisense feature to see the other overloads for the <span class="code">Register</span>
    method.
</div>

<h2>Add some elements to your website</h2>

<p>
    At this point your website is scanning the classes compiled into the application assembly
    and registering them with the element builder, but it will not find any classes like that
    because we did not add any yet.
</p>

<p>
    The code you wrote so far scans the main assembly of your application, so you can add
    pages, regions, layouts, components, templates etc anywhere within the source code and
    they will be discovered. It is entirely up to you how you organize these classes, but you
    might like to read the <a href="/content/general/bestpractice/landing">Best Practice Guide</a>
    before moving on from this getting started example.
</p>

<p>
    If you want to finish up the "Hello, World" example you can copy code from
    <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/OwinFramework.Pages/blob/master/Sample2/Startup.cs"><span class="code">Startup.cs</span></a>,
    or you can experiment with creating some pages of your own. If you would like to
    see some examples of how to define these page elements you can check out
    <a href="https://github.com/Bikeman868/OwinFramework.Pages/blob/master/Sample1/SamplePages/DeclarativePage.cs">this source file</a>.
</p>

<p>
    A compact version of Hello World can be written like this:
</p>

<pre>
[IsPage]                                                   // This is a webpage
[Route("/", Method.Get)]                                   // This page is served for GET requets for the website root
[PageTitle("Getting started with Owin Framework Pages")]   // Specifies the page title
[UsesLayout("homePageLayout")]                             // The layout of this page is 'homePageLayout'
internal class HomePage { }

[IsLayout("homePageLayout", "region1")]                    // The 'homePageLayout' has 1 region called 'region1'
[RegionHtml("region1", "hello-world", "Hello, world")]     // Region 1 contains static Html
internal class HomePageLayout { }
</pre>

<p>
    If you press F5 at this point the project should comiple and launch
    IIS express to display the web page. Try using the "View Source" option
    in your browser to see the HTML that was produced.
</p>

<p>
    You will see that the HTML contains comments to help you to identify
    the layouts, regions and components that were involved in constructing
    the HTML. You can turn off these comments by configuring the Pages
    middleware like this:
</p>

<pre>
var configurationStore = ninject.Get&lt;IConfigurationStore>();
configurationStore.UpdateConfiguration(
@"{
    ""owinFramework"":{
        ""pages"":{
            ""html"":{
                ""IncludeComments"":false
            }
        }
    }
}");
</pre>
