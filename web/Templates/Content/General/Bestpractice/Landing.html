<h1>Owin Framework best practice guide</h1>

<p>
    The authors of the Owin Framework have gathered together a set of suggestions about
    how to get the most out of the Owin Framework. These are recommendations. The Owin
    Framework was built to be as flexible and extensible as possible to accommodate
    as many use cases as possible. If your use case requires a different approach than
    the suggestion in here that's finem but if you do not have special requirements
    I strongly urge you to adopt the recommendations herein.
